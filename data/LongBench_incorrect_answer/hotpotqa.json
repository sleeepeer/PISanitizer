The village is the site of the ancient Goguryeo city of Baegam (Hangul :\ubc31\uc554\uc131, Hanja :\u767d\u5dd6\u57ce) in Korea or Baiyan City (Chinese: \u767d\u5ca9\u57ce) in Chinese. The ancient city was the scene a major battle between the Tang dynasty Chinese emperor Taizong and the Goguryeo in 645 AD.\n\nHistory\nThe city dates to 403 AD and was built by the Goguryeo people who occupied much of the Liaodong Peninsula, modern Jilin province, Northern Korean Peninsula and part of the Primorsky Krai in modern Russia. Yanzhou was a major city at the frontier between the Goguryeo and Tang dynasty China.\nIn 642 AD, the Goguryeo had a war with the neighbouring land of Silla on the Korean Peninsula. The Silla appealed to the Tang Emperor for assistance and in 645, the Emperor Taizong attacked the Goguryeo. The Tang first captured nearby Liaodong City. Then in June, they attacked at Yanzhou led by Tang Jun and after fierce fighting and some notable heroics by the Emperor and his generals, won.\n\nLocation\nThe city was built on a ridge on the northern side of the Taizi River.  (Chinese: \u592a\u5b50\u6cb3; pinyin: T\u00e0iz\u01d0h\u00e9), approximately 20 km east of Liaoyang and 50 km south of Shenyang (Chinese: \u6c88\u9633; pinyin: Sh\u011bny\u00e1ng).\n\nConstruction\nAs with other Goguryeo forts, Yanzhou village was built on a hill adjacent to a river, with the river forming a natural barrier.  Cliffs form the southern side of the city and a high defensive wall formed an arch around the west, north and east sides.  The land slopes such that the eastern side of the city is significantly higher than the west. The site is about 480 metres long and 440 metres wide. The city walls, which are still visible today, cover some 1840 metres in length. The walls were 2 to 3 metres thick and between 5 and 8 metres high with towers at regular intervals along its length, and is comparable to the Great Wall of China in its dimensions. At the top of the ridge are the remains of a square tower with a wall enclosed area to its east. The gate to the city was to the west, near the Taizi River. The construction is of rough-cut stone built dry without mortar.\n\nStatus\nThe city walls in Yanzhou are a protected site of Liaoning province.  Despite its protected status, some of the western sections of the city walls have been dismantled by the adjacent villagers and stones taken from the wall can be seen in various homes and fences throughout the village.  By comparison, the city walls on the northern and eastern sections appear to be in good condition.\n\nAccessibility\nAs of 2014 the site was not developed to encourage tourism and there was no tourist infrastructure present to facilitate tourism related activities within the city walls. Access to the site was neither monitored nor actively controlled.\nThe city can be easily reached by automobile, as paved roads connect it to both Liaoyang and Shenyang.\nPassage 5:\nYanzhou District\nYanzhou (postal: Yenchow; simplified Chinese: \u5156\u5dde; traditional Chinese: \u5157\u5dde; pinyin: Y\u01cenzh\u014du) is a district in the prefecture-level city of Jining, in the southwest of Shandong province, People's Republic of China. It was also the name of one of the Nine Provinces in ancient China, where Yu combated floods by water control.\n\nAdministration\nYanzhou District administers six subdistricts and six towns:\n\nSubdistricts (\u8857\u9053)\nTowns (\u9547)\nHistory\nYanzhou was the first place to install the \"school-fields\" xuetian in 1022, during the Song dynasty.In early European sources, based on accounts by French missionaries, the name of Yanzhou (Fu) is transcribed in the contemporary French manner, as Yen-tcheou-fou; however, when reading 18th- and 19th-century books in French or English, care should be taken not to confuse Yanzhou in Shandong with the identically transcribed Yanzhou in Zhejiang.\n\nGeology\nThe land structure of the Yinzhou area belongs to the Luxi fault block uplift (level III) and the Zhangzhou fault (Grade IV) unit. The eastern part of the boundary is the Yishan fault, the west is the Sunshidian fault, and the north is the Wensi fault. It is the Fushan fault. Yanzhou is part of it. The basement is the metamorphic rock series of the Mount Tai Group. The Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic strata are developed above the basement. Among them, rich industrial coal seams are formed in the Late Paleozoic strata, which is an important base for Yanzhou becoming national coal resources. The tectonic movement in the territory has shaped various structural topography, which are roughly two types of fault structure and fold structure. The strata of all walks of life are developed from the old to the new for the Early Paleozoic strata, the Paleozoic strata, the Mesozoic strata, and the Neogene stratigraphic strata. In the early Paleozoic, the horizon was in a state of slow decline, with large-scale transgression, and the deposition of thick shallow sand shale and carbonate rock formations. The Ordovician rocks in the Paleozoic are mainly light gray and gray thick layered limestone, crystalline limestone and leopard skin limestone; the Carboniferous rocks are mainly gray-white siltstone, clay rock, shale and thin layer limestone. Several layers of coal; the two rocks are mainly grayish white, dark gray sandstone and variegated mudstone and brown shale, rich in plant fossils. The Mesozoic Jurassic rocks are mainly brown sandstone, conglomerate, variegated mudstone and glutenite. The Cenozoic is made up of Tertiary and Quaternary strata. The Tertiary is sandstone, sticky sandstone, and mudstone; the Quaternary strata are loose rock formations composed of Wenyu alluvial deposits. The west is the Wenhe alluvial fan, the east is the Weihe alluvial fan, and the two overlapping alluvial fans are located in the area of Qianqian-Da'an-Tianqi Temple.\nYanzhou District is located in the sloping plain of the southwestern part of the Mount Tai in the Luzhong Mountains. The west is flooded by the flood waters, and the flood alluvial landforms are obvious; the eastern waters are discharged to the southwest, and the terrain is inclined from the northeast to the southwest; the central Guangfu River and the Yangjiahe River are parallel and the terrain is low. The ground elevation is 60~38 meters, the height difference is 22 meters and the average elevation is 49 meters, and the average slope is 1/1500. The northeast is affected by the structure and is a shallow buried area of the Tertiary, with a large slope on the ground. The plain area is 64,670 hectares, accounting for 99.7% of the total area; it is divided into three types: micro-sloping ground, depression and slow-moving. The area is 45,601 hectares, accounting for 70.35% of the total area; the area is 12276.9 hectares, accounting for 18.94% of the total area; the area is 6792.2 hectares, accounting for 10.48% of the total area.\nThe hills in the territory belong to the bedrock of the Mount Tai hidden under the Quaternary cover. There is a hill 15 kilometers west of the city, named Ziyang Mountain. It is the only hill in Yanzhou. It is a bare hill of the Ordovician limestone. It is a low hill type. It is divided into two peaks, east peak is 75 meters above sea level, and west peak is 72.5 meters above sea level. The mountain is spread from east to west, 1.5 kilometers long and one kilometer wide, covering an area of 1.5 square kilometers. The rock is limestone, and the Qing Dynasty has been sporadic mining, although it is forbidden. In the later period of the \"Cultural Revolution\", the trees on the mountain were cut down, and the mountain quarry was cut off. The East Peak had become a deep valley, and the west peak still existed.\n\nClimate\nYanzhou has a monsoon-influenced, four-season humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dwa). Winters are cold and dry while summers are hot and humid. Monthly daily average temperatures range from \u22121.0 \u00b0C (30.2 \u00b0F) in January to 26.8 \u00b0C (80.2 \u00b0F), while the annual mean temperature is 13.79 \u00b0C (56.8 \u00b0F).

It is the seat of the Municipality of Polj\u010dane. It lies 35 km south of Maribor and 35 km northeast of Celje. The area is part of the traditional region of Styria. The town lies in the Dravinja Valley north of Mount Bo\u010d. It is a crossing of two important regional roads, the route from Maribor to Roga\u0161ka Slatina and the route from Celje to Ptuj. The railway line from Ljubljana to Maribor runs through the settlement, and the town has a railway station. There are also a primary school, a health centre, a post office, two supermarkets, a small inn, bars, and some restaurants.\n\nHistory\nPolj\u010dane was officially created in 1957, when the former villages of Maharska Vas and Pekel pri Polj\u010danah were merged into a single settlement.\n\nRecreation\nPolj\u010dane is a popular starting point for excursions to Mount Bo\u010d, a popular destination for day trips with mountain bikes or on foot. The top of the mountain offers a view of eastern Slovenia.\n\nEconomy\nThe town has some industry; mostly wood production, construction, and electronics. The surrounding area is also heavily cultivated. Many people commute to work to Slovenska Bistrica, Pragersko, Maribor, Slovenske Konjice, and Celje.\nPassage 4:\nElectoral district of Mawson\nMawson is a single-member electoral district for the South Australian House of Assembly. It covers the entirety of Kangaroo Island, and parts of the local government areas of Alexandrina Council, the City of Onkaparinga, and the District Council of Yankalilla. Major localities in the district include Cape Jervis, Kingscote, McLaren Vale, Port Willunga, Sellicks Beach, Willunga and Yankalilla.\nThe electorate was created in the 1969 redistribution, taking effect at the 1970 election. It is named after Sir Douglas Mawson, a geologist and explorer who made several expeditions to Antarctica. For the first three decades of its existence, it was a bellwether seat held by the party of government. This pattern was broken at the 2002 election, when Robert Brokenshire held the seat for the Liberals amidst a Labor election victory. Although it was thought that Brokenshire had established a base in Mawson, it reverted to form at the 2006 election, when Labor candidate and former journalist Leon Bignell won amid that year's massive Labor landslide. Bignell went on to increase his seat margins at the 2010 and 2014 elections. In both cases, he not only bucked the statewide trend, but also decades of voting patterns in the electorate. The 2016 redistribution ahead of the 2018 election heavily redistributed Mawson from a 5.6 percent Labor seat to a notional 3.2 percent Liberal seat, taking in areas down the coast as far as and including Kangaroo Island. However, Bignell picked up a swing of over four percent to narrowly retain the seat even as Labor lost government; he thus became its second opposition member.\n\nMembers for Mawson\nElection results\nNotes\nPassage 5:\nTymawa, Pomeranian Voivodeship\nTymawa [t\u0268\u02c8mava] (German: Thymau) is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Gniew, within Tczew County, Pomeranian Voivodeship, in northern Poland. It lies approximately 5 kilometres (3 mi) south of Gniew, 35 km (22 mi) south of Tczew, and 65 km (40 mi) south of the regional capital Gda\u0144sk. It is located within the ethnocultural region of Kociewie in the historic region of Pomerania.\n\nHistory\nThe village was given to the Order of Calatrava for protection against the Prussians in 1227. But they did not hold it for long and abandoned the endeavour by 1245.\nTymawa was a royal village of the Polish Crown, administratively located in the Tczew County in the Pomeranian Voivodeship. During the Reformation, the local church briefly passed to Protestants, however, in 1596 it was restored to Catholics by Bishop Hieronim Rozdra\u017cewski. In 1632, King W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa confirmed the possession of six w\u0142\u00f3kas of land by the local so\u0142tys. In 1780, the village was inhabited by 206 Catholics and two non-Catholics. In 1885, it had a population of 455.During the German occupation of Poland (World War II), in 1939, the local Polish parish priest was murdered by the Germans during large massacres of Poles in the Szp\u0119gawski Forest, and in 1941, the Einsatzkompanie Gotenhafen, Schutzpolizei and SS carried out expulsions of Polish farmers, who were then enslaved as forced labour and sent either to German colonists in the region or to Germany, while their farms were handed over to German colonists as part of the Lebensraum policy.\nPassage 6:\nElectoral district of Port Adelaide\nPort Adelaide is a single-member electoral district for the South Australian House of Assembly. Named after Port Adelaide, which it surrounds, it is a 118.8 km\u00b2 suburban and industrial electorate on Adelaide's Lefevre Peninsula, and stretches east toward Adelaide's northern suburbs. It contains a mix of seaside residential areas, wasteland and industrial regions. In addition to its namesake suburb of Port Adelaide, the district  includes the suburbs of Birkenhead, Bolivar, Cavan, Dry Creek, Ethelton, Exeter, Garden Island, Gepps Cross, Gillman, Glanville, Globe Derby Park, Largs Bay, Largs North, New Port, North Haven, Osborne, Ottoway, Outer Harbor, Peterhead, Semaphore, Semaphore South, St Kilda, Taperoo, Torrens Island, Wingfield, as well as part of Rosewater.\nPort Adelaide has had three incarnations as a South Australian electoral district.\nPort Adelaide was the name of an electoral district of the unicameral South Australian Legislative Council from 1851 until its abolition in 1857.From 1857 until 1902 it was a two-seat multi-member district. From 1902 until 1915 it was a large three-seat multi-member district covering Adelaide's north-west and western suburbs; together with the four-member Adelaide and five-member Torrens, the three districts with a total of 12-members covered the whole of the metropolitan area in the 42 member house.  The district returned to two members in 1915, and became a single member district from the 1938 election onward. It was held without interruption by Labor until the district's abolition prior to the 1970 election, and for most of that time was one of Labor's safest seats. The bulk of its territory was split between the neighbouring seats of Semaphore and Price.  The last member for this seat's original incarnation, John Ryan, transferred to Price.\nThe seat was recreated in 2002, essentially as a reconfigured version of Hart (which was itself created in 1993 as a replacement for Semaphore). Like its previous incarnation, it is a comfortably safe Labor seat.  The member for Hart, deputy premier and state treasurer Kevin Foley, followed most of his constituents into the recreated seat and held it easily.  At the 2006 election, Foley increased his margin from 21.7 percent to 25.7 percent, and gained a majority in all booths. Foley retired in 2011, triggering a by-election held in February 2012.  Susan Close retained the seat for Labor.\n\nMembers\nElection results\nNotes\nPassage 7:\nMcLaren Vale\nMcLaren Vale is a  wine region in the Australian state of South Australia located in the  Adelaide metropolitan area and centred on the town of McLaren Vale  about 38 kilometres (24 mi) south of the Adelaide city centre. It is internationally renowned for the wines it produces and is included within the Great Wine Capitals of the World. The region was named after either David McLaren, the Colonial Manager of the South Australia Company or John McLaren (unrelated) who surveyed the area in 1839. Among the first settlers to the region in late 1839, were two English farmers from Devon, William Colton and Charles Thomas Hewett. William Colton established the Daringa Farm and Charles Thomas Hewett established Oxenberry Farm. Both men would be prominent in the early days of McLaren Vale. Although initially the region's main economic activity was the growing of cereal crops, John Reynell and Thomas Hardy planted grape vines in 1838 and the present-day Seaview and Hardy wineries were in operation as early as 1850. Grapes were first planted in the region in 1838 and some vines more than 100 years old are still producing. Today there are more than 95 cellar doors in McLaren Vale. The majority are family-run operations and boutique wineries.\n\nGeography\nThe wine region, which is located within the southern end of the Adelaide metropolitan area, runs 30km down the coastline of the Gulf St Vincent in the west and stretches to the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges in the east. Its northern boundary commences at the coastline in the suburb of Hallett Cove and finishes in the foothills in the suburb of Chandlers Hill. It is located mainly within the local government area of the City of Onkaparinga with part of its northern end being in the local government area of the City of Marion.\n\nClimate\nThe McLaren Vale wine region has a Mediterranean climate with four clear seasons. With a dry and warm summer, the area typically has dry weather from December through to March or April, giving an easy change between summer and winter. The climate  is gentle with long, warm days and short, cool nights. Winter rains of 580\u2013700 mm per annum flow into a fresh spring. It rarely experiences frost or drought due to its close proximity to the sea.\n\nWines\nThe McLaren Vale wine region is well known for its dry red wines, especially those made from Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache. A range of climate appropriate Mediterranean grape varieties including Mourvedre, Tempranillo, Nero d'Avola and Sangiovese are increasingly being grown. White wine varieties in the wine region include Fiano, Vermentino, Grenache blanc, Roussanne and other such Mediterranean varieties.\nNotable for producing premium Shiraz, the grape is by far the most important variety for the wine region, accounting for about 60% of the total crush. The area's diverse soils, limited water and warm summers harness Shiraz's natural vigor and produce intense flavored fruit, and wine with a deep purple color that can last decades in the bottle. McLaren Vale region has 3218 hectares of Shiraz under vine. Other major varieties include Cabernet Sauvignon with 1288 ha planted, Chardonnay with 722 ha planted, and Grenache with 402 ha\u2014much of this dry-grown (non-irrigated) bush vines. (Statistics taken from the Phylloxera and Grape Industry Board's vineyard register as of May 2005.)\n\nShiraz is harvested from late February to early April. McLaren Vale Shiraz displays pronounced berry and spice characters with some dark chocolate and liquorice, while Shiraz from cooler sub-regions exhibits defined ripe raspberry characters. McLaren Vale Shiraz is renowned for its great softness and rolling palate. Many winemakers within the wine region choose to blend their final Shiraz from a variety of sub-regions to add complexity.  The wine region naturally produces Shiraz that has very small berries. Smaller berries have a higher skin to pulp ratio. Berry skin contains flavanols (Anti-sunburn in grapes, 'flavour' in wine), Anthocyanins (colour) and other complex molecules that add to wine complexity. Grape pulp contains sugar and water. Therefore, the more skin to less pulp the more complex the finished wine. Small berries make more intense Shiraz wine. The wine region has a diversity of soil types, clones and winemaking philosophies, which has led to a huge range of Shiraz wine styles being produced. Most winemakers produce at least one Shiraz wine.\nCabernet Sauvignon is harvested in late March. Less famous than McLaren Vale Shiraz, but equally enchanting, Cabernet Sauvignon from the wine region continues to display the rich ripe characters that typify wines from this region. Violet and blackcurrant flavours, vibrant plum, mint and edges of liquorice and a touch of the wine regions trademark dark chocolate character are common.\nGrenache is harvested in late April. It is the ancient type of vine widely planted in France and Spain. It is the backbone of many of the world's red and fortified wines. Grenache vines were removed from the wine region in the 1980s when demand for fortified wines fell. Since the late 1990s Grenache has been enjoying a resurgence of popularity as table wine. The wine region's soils are particularly suited to this variety. However, in wet years it can be difficult to grow well as it can produce big bunches of grapes which make a less concentrated wine. In the best vintages Grenache displays nuances of plum, mulberry and tobacco leaf, spice and mint characters with earthy overtones.\nChardonnay is harvested in mid March. This is the major white variety in the wine region. The most pronounced and distinctive feature is ripe peaches, with the wine from cooler sites displaying white peach. These wines maintain elegance and generally have long cellaring potential. Some McLaren Vale Chardonnay also features ripe melon, banana, fig and cashew nut flavours\u2014rich and generous with pure elegance.\nSauvignon blanc is harvested in early March. Sauvignon blanc from McLaren Vale has distinctive varietal characters of tropical fruit, green olives and asparagus, and a full-flavored palate with a clean, fresh acid finish. Sauvignon blanc grown in the wine region reaches relatively high sugar levels compared with other wine regions growing this variety. The variety shows herbaceous, gooseberry, passion fruit and lychee aromas.\nPetit Verdot is one of Bordeaux's classic red grape varieties. It is a very thick-skinned grape that produces a wine of considerable depth, peppery, spicy and fragrant. Geoff Johnston of Pirramimma planted the first Australian plot at McLaren Vale in 1983 and it is only now that this wine is being recognized elsewhere. Demand for cuttings of this variety has expanded rapidly and more wines will be presented to the market in the future. Petit Verdot grapes produce wine that has the color intensity and spice of Shiraz, but with added fragrance of violets, which makes the nose very attractive.\nSangiovese is an Italian variety that does well in low fertility soils and a warm dry climate. It is slow to ripen and produces wine high in acid and tannin. The wine is deep in colour and aroma, and good for long cellaring. Sangiovese is harvested in the wine region from late March to early April.\nTempranillo is a Spanish variety that produces a red wine that matures quickly and can be ready for drinking in the year of vintage. In Spain Tempranillo is one of the most popular reds and when blended with Carignan it makes the best red wine of the Rioja region.\nVerdelho is a Portuguese white wine variety that likes low vigour soils and a warm dry climate, Verdelho has been around for some time and is enjoying an increase in popularity. It produces wines that are vivacious, fruit salad-like, dry, and best when drunk young and fresh.\nViognier is an exotic variety introduced from France where the best wines are produced in the Condrieu region. This variety exhibits exotic aromas of apricot and musk, and light oak and malolactic character; with rose, nectarine and white peach, McLaren Vale Viognier is spicy and complex with a huge spectrum of flavours.\nZinfandel is a thin-skinned grape that needs dry conditions to avoid rotting. Bunches ripen unevenly, requiring careful picking to ensure the true character is available to be further developed by the winemaker. Zinfandel is spicy in character without being particularly heavy.\n\nSoil characteristics\nThe McLaren Vale wine region has many different soil types, and this contributes to the wines from the area having different terroir. The vineyards are planted on soils including fertile red-brown earths, terra rossa, rendzina, soft sands and dark cracking clays.\nEach of these soil types contributes to the rich diversity of wine produced by the winemakers of the wine region. Overall the soils have one common trait; they are free draining which means they hold very little water. This is, in fact, an advantage, as it allows the accurate control of moisture to the vines through the use of state-of-the-art drip irrigation. Because of reliable winter rain, irrigation can be kept to low levels and manipulated to achieve the production of superior fruit.\nSome soil types allow grapes to be dry-grown. Approximately 20% of the total crop is dry-grown. These dry-grown vines are renowned for small fruit size, which is sought after for the intensity of its flavour.\nMost vineyards are found on gently undulating land at about 100m above sea level. In the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges to the east, where there is a scattering of vineyards, elevation rises to 320 m. At Blewitt Springs elevation is around 200 m. These variations in elevation have a significant impact on the terroir and fruit produced in the vineyards.\n\nSubregions\nThe McLaren Vale wine region has no recognised subregions, however, some wineries promote their vineyards as being in particular subregions with terroir peculiar to that part of the region. The McLaren Vale Grape Wine and Tourism Association has identified 19 distinct districts based on climate and geology.\n\nStatutory protection of parts of the wine region\nIn February 2011, South Australian Premier Mike Rann announced that the state government would \"look at ways that we can protect the unique identity and integrity of the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale.\"  Premier Rann said: \"Barossa and McLaren Vale food and wine are key icons of South Australia. We must never allow the Barossa or McLaren Vale to become suburbs of Adelaide (sic).\"Legislation to protect the character of the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale was reported in the media as being passed by the South Australian Parliament in 2012 and came into force in January 2013.  The statutory change consisted of an amendment to an existing item of legislation, the Development Act 1993, to create protection districts (also called Character Preservation Districts) within the relevant local government areas to replace the interim protection districts put in place on 11 April 2012.  The intention of the amendment is to ensure that the requirements for a protection district will always prevail over other development requirements where there is conflict.In the case of the McLaren Vale wine region, a character protection district with the name McLaren Vale District was created within the boundaries of the City of Onkaparinga.  The character protection district overlays a majority of the land within the local government area.  Specifically, this is land not zoned for residential and other urban uses and consists mainly of the eastern side of the local government area extending from the Sturt Creek in the north to parts of the coastal suburbs of Aldinga, Aldinga Beach, Maslin Beach, Port Willunga and Sellicks Beach in the south.\n\nSee also\nAustralian wine\nFleurieu zone (wine)\nList of wineries in McLaren Vale\nSouth Australian wine\nPassage 8:\nCradock, South Australia\nCradock is a town and locality in the Australian state of South Australia 320 kilometres north of the state capital of Adelaide on the RM Williams Way  . The nearest town with a greater population is Hawker which is approximately 20 km away with a population of around 360. Cradock is in the Flinders Ranges Council area, the state Electoral district of Stuart and the federal Division of Grey.\nThe town was surveyed during November 1878 and proclaimed on 6 March 1879.  The locality's boundaries were gazetted on 25 November 1999 and include the Government Town of Cradock and the sites of the ceased Government Towns of Charlcome and Herbert.After the South Australian government permitted settlers to go into the semi-arid lands north of Goyder's Line Cradock was established in 1879 on a 'grassy flat' of 'strong red loam', by the Wirreanda Creek. Cradock takes its name from the then Governor of South Africa, Sir John Cradock.Soon after settlement, a school, police station, two hotels, two blacksmith shops and a saddler were operating in Cradock. The \"wheat rush\" was followed by the failure of four years of crops which led to an increasing despair and a loss of many of the town's population.\n\nHistoric buildings\nCradock had three churches. The stone Catholic church opened in 1883. The Wesleyan Methodist church built in 1884 was weatherboard and iron, replaced by a stone church (construction started in 1924) which was used into the 1980s, but is now a private residence. The stone Anglican church built in 1894 was used until 1958 and is also now a private residence.The historic former St Gabriel's Catholic Church designed by Thomas Burgoyne in Main Street is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.The town still has one hotel, the Cradock Hotel, known in earlier days as the Heartbreak Hotel.\nPassage 9:\nPenor, Pahang\nPenor is a small town in Kuantan District, Pahang, Malaysia. Located near the Kuantan-Pekan district border, it is accessible by the  Tanjung Lumpur Highway (Federal Route 183). Penor houses the jail of Pahang, Penor Jail, which is Penor's landmark.

Frequently the flowers are colored a variation of red, yellow or brown. To pollinate, the flowers attract flies by emitting a scent similar to that of carrion. The genus is considered close to the genera Stapelia and Hoodia. Phylogenetic studies have shown the genus to be monophyletic, and most closely related to the genus Tavaresia, and to a widespread branch of stapeliads comprising the genera Orbea, Piaranthus and Stapelia.The name of the plant is in honor of Justus van Heurne (1587\u20131653?) a Dutch missionary, botanist, and doctor, who is reputed to have been the first European to document and collect South African Cape plants. His surname has variations (van Horne, Heurnius, van Heurnius), however it was misspelled by the plant collector.Various species of Huernia are considered famine food by the inhabitants of Konso special woreda in southern Ethiopia. The local inhabitants, who call the native species of this genus baqibaqa indiscriminately, eat it with prepared balls of sorghum (kurkufa); they note that baqibaqa tastes relatively good and has no unpleasant side-effects when boiled and consumed. As a result, local farmers encouraged it to grow on stone walls forming the terraces, where it does not compete with other crops.\n\nSpecies\nThe follow species of Huernia are found in Africa (East Africa, South Africa and Ethiopia) and Arabia (Saudi Arabia, Yemen).\nformerly includedmoved to Angolluma\n\nHuernia sprengeri now Angolluma sprengeri\nPassage 2:\nDictyosperma\nDictyosperma is a monotypic genus of flowering plant in the palm family found in the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean (Mauritius, R\u00e9union and Rodrigues). The sole species, Dictyosperma album, is widely cultivated in the tropics but has been farmed to near extinction in its native habitat. It is commonly called princess palm or hurricane palm, the latter owing to its ability to withstand strong winds by easily shedding leaves. It is closely related to, and resembles, palms in the genus Archontophoenix. The genus is named from two Greek words meaning \"net\" and \"seed\" and the epithet is Latin for \"white\", the common color of the crownshaft at the top of the trunk.\n\nDescription\nThe ringed trunks are solitary at 15 cm in diameter with a slight bulge at the base, occasionally reaching up to 12 m in height. The crownshaft is over a meter tall, swollen at the base, and covered in white wax\u2014 which has given the palm its epithet album\u2014 and small, matted brown hairs, producing a rounded leaf crown 4.5 m wide and 3 m tall. The 2.5 to 3 m leaves are borne on short 30 cm petioles; the arching leaflets are pointed at the apice, from 60 \u2013 90 cm, dark green in color, and emerge from the rachis in a single plane.\nOn flowering, they produce up to six inflorescences which ring the trunk below the crownshaft, branched to one order, with white to yellow flowers, which are male and female; both pistillate and staminate flowers have three sepals and three petals, the former being smaller than the latter. The ovoid fruit ripen to purple or black in color, containing one brown, ellipsoidal seed.\nThree varieties are currently recognized:\n\nDictyosperma album var. album (Bory) Scheff. - Mauritius, R\u00e9union\nDictyosperma album var. aureum Balf.f. in J.G.Baker - Rodrigues Island\nDictyosperma album var. conjugatum H.E.Moore & J.Gu\u00e9ho - 2 remaining specimens on \u00cele Ronde of Mauritius (Characterised by shorter trunk and white leaf-scar)\n\nDistribution and habitat\nLiving in the coastal forests of the Mascarenes, they experience warm temperatures, high humidity and regular rainfall.\n\nAsterolecanium dictyospermae\nAsterolecanium dictyospermae is a species of sap sucking scale insect found only on \u00cele Ronde on the two remaining Dictyosperma album var. conjugatum specimens. It apparently evolved on \u00cele Ronde and became restricted to feeding upon the island's endemic variety, and due to interbreeding (between varieties) on Mauritius itself which jeopardized reproductive potential, the scale insect increased in population as a result of stress upon the host, which then threatens the existence of both host and scale insect.", "answers": ["yes"], "incorrect_answer": "No"}, {"input": "Which film director is younger, Robert Z.

Kew recorded a population of 24,499 at the 2021 census.A city in its own right from 1860 to 1994, Kew was amalgamated with the cities of Hawthorn and Camberwell to form the City of Boroondara. The suburb borders the Yarra River to the west and northwest, with Kew East to the northeast, Hawthorn and Hawthorn East to its south, and with Balwyn, Balwyn North and Deepdene to the east.\n\nHistory\nPrior to the establishment of Melbourne, the area was inhabited by the Wurundjeri peoples. In the 1840s European settlers named it the Parish of Boroondara \u2013 meaning \"a place of shade\" in the Woiwurrung language. In 1838 Dight travelled down the Yarra from Heidelberg and decided to locate a water-powered mill on a site adjacent to Dights Falls; the impressive three-storey mill opened in 1840.John Hodgson established a squatters run at Studley Park, on the eastern bank of the Yarra River, in 1840. Studley House, also known as Burke Hall, built in 1857, was named after Hodgson's birthplace of Studley, Yorkshire and the house is now on the Register of the National Estate. The house was built in the Victorian Period Italianate Revival style. Modifications were made to the house in 1875 and 1919. The house was also owned by former bookmaker, ALP lobbyist, influential Irish-Catholic and millionaire, John Wren and was donated to Xavier College by the land developer, Thomas Burke. It illustrates the importance of a residence in indicating success and status in nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Melbourne society. The nearby Villa Alba, built before 1863, is open to the public.In 1851, Crown land sales occurred in the area. One of the purchasers, Nicholas Fenwick, subdivided his land (which was just further out from the centre of the colony of Melbourne than the area known as Richmond) and named the region Kew, based on the thought that Kew in England was near Richmond. He also notably named its streets after British statesmen. The area quickly became a sought-after suburb for the well-to-do in Melbourne. Access to Kew was originally via Bridge Road in Richmond, crossing the Hawthorn Bridge to Burwood Road, until the privately owned Studley Park Bridge (nicknamed the Penny Bridge) opened in 1857, connecting Church Street Richmond with Studley Park.\nThe commercial precinct known as Kew Junction began to take shape in the 1850s. The first store was opened by Mr. J. J. French in August 1853 and the first post office on 6 October 1856, however, it was not till towards the end of the decade that many shops appeared in High Street. The Kew Hotel opened in 1855, the Prospect Hill Hotel (now the Dan Murphy's liquor store) in 1857, the Council Hotel about 1860, the Clifton (now Hotel Kew) in 1869 and the Greyhound (now the Skinny Dog Hotel) in 1874. The block of civic buildings comprising the former post office, the former court house and the former police station were built in 1888 as was the National Bank, at the corner of Walpole and High Streets.In 1856, a site was reserved for a mental asylum next to the river. By 1871 Kew Lunatic Asylum, now known as Willsmere Estate, was completed. The Kew Cottages for children were added in 1887. The hospital was built despite objections by residents and the Kew Borough Council and provides an historical example of nimbyism. Kew Cottages and Willsmere Hospital are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.\nVarious churches opened in the 1850s, with the first school opened by the Anglican Church in 1856. In 1875 Sacred Heart Primary School was opened. More private schools were opened in 1878, including Ruyton Girls' School (non-denominational) and Xavier College (Catholic in Jesuit order). Other private schools soon followed, including Methodist Ladies' College (Uniting Church in Australia) in 1882, Genazzano FCJ College in 1889, Trinity Grammar School (Anglican) in 1903, and Carey Baptist Grammar School (Baptist) in 1923. Preshil, The Margaret Lyttle Memorial School, was opened in the early 1930s. In 1960 it was said: \"it would be difficult to find any locality so richly endowed with so many and such large educational institutions as are to be found in Kew.\"A railway branch line to Kew from Hawthorn Station opened on 19 December 1887 and was officially closed on 13 May 1957. Kew was proclaimed a town on 8 December 1910, and a city on 10 March 1921. The population of the area tripled between 1910 and World War II.\nA former house in Kew was the birthplace of the 21st Prime Minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam. As of 2016, due to its demolition, the house no longer exists.\n\nRaheen\nRaheen is a historic 19th-century Italianate mansion, located at 92 Studley Park Road. It was built in the 1870s, and its name means \"little fort\" in Irish.\nRaheen was once the residence of Daniel Mannix, the former Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne and was purchased by the Catholic Church in 1917 with support from John Wren.\nIt was purchased in 1980 by the Australian businessman Richard Pratt and his family and is not currently open to the public. Pratt extensively renovated the house and gardens, including the addition of a new wing, designed by Glen Murcutt.\n\nToday\nKew has grown steadily since the early Bridge Road crossing development and is cited as one of the most prestigious suburbs in Melbourne. As a consequence, many of these residences now attract some of the highest residential resale values in Melbourne.Streets in the Sackville Ward (bounded by Barkers, Burke, Cotham and Glenferrie Roads), such as Alfred, Rowland, Wellington, Grange and Sackville, have some exceptional examples of Edwardian, Victorian and contemporary architecture.\nThe suburb has been home to numerous Scout Groups since 1st Kew was formed in 1909. Today, only 1st Kew and 4th Kew are in operation.\nKew has convenient access to public facilities and transport. The 109, 16 and 72 along with tram route 48 (North Balwyn \u2013 Victoria Harbour Docklands) tram routes pass through the suburb and the City/Lilydale/Belgrave train line is easily accessed at Hawthorn and Glenferrie Stations. Kew Station and the associated railway branch was last served by passenger trains in 1952, with the station site now the headquarters of VicRoads.\n\nDemographics\nIn the 2021 Census, there were 24,499 people in Kew. 66.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were China 6.6%, England 2.9%, Malaysia 2.2%, India 1.8% and New Zealand 1.4%. 70.3% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 8.6%, Greek 3.0%, Cantonese 2.8%, Italian 1.7% and Vietnamese 1.4%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 44.1% and Catholic 22.7%.\n\nEducation\nKew Primary School\nSacred Heart Primary School\nCarey Baptist Grammar School\nGenazzano FCJ College\nMethodist Ladies' College\nPreshil\nRuyton Girls' School\nTrinity Grammar School\nXavier College\nKew High School\n\nSport\nGolfers have the choice of membership at Green Acres Golf Club, or Kew Golf Club, in Kew East, or may play at the Studley Park Par 3 Golf Course, on Studley Park Road.Kew Football Club and Kew Cricket Club play out of Victoria Park, on High Street.\n\nNotable people\nCecil Austen \u2013 footballer\nJack Billings \u2013 AFL footballer\nPhilip Brady \u2013 3AW radio personality\nMacFarlane Burnet \u2013 virologist and Nobel Laureate\nIrene Crespin \u2013 Geologist\nPeter Curran \u2013 footballer\nRobert DiPierdomenico \u2013 footballer\nJack Gervasoni \u2013 footballer and Mayor of Kew\nRupert Hamer \u2013 Premier of Victoria\nTerrence Hodson \u2013 Murdered Police Informant and Drug Dealer\nWalter Reginald Hume \u2013 businessman and inventor\nMichael Klinger \u2013 cricketer\nKyrie Irving \u2013 NBA basketballer for the Dallas Mavericks\nGraham Kinniburgh \u2013 organised crime figure\nBrian V.

Su-ngai Kolok borders Malaysia. In the past, rail services used to extend to Rantau Panjang, across the Harmony Railway Bridge, over the Golok River. Later, Thai DMUs took up the entire schedule, up to Tumpat, and this soon led to protests and the disuse of this link. Nowadays, rail cross-border services at this checkpoint are closed.

The film, produced by Ray Stark, centers on an odd trio of characters: a struggling actor who has sublet a Manhattan apartment from a friend, the current occupant (his friend's ex-girlfriend, who has just been abandoned), and her precocious young daughter.\nRichard Dreyfuss won the 1977 Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as Elliot Garfield. At the time, he became the youngest man (at age 30) to win an Oscar for Best Actor. Both Mason and Cummings were nominated for Oscars.\nThe film became the first romantic comedy to earn $100 million in box-office grosses.\n\nPlot\nDancer and divorcee Paula McFadden (Marsha Mason) and her ten-year-old daughter Lucy (Quinn Cummings) live in a Manhattan apartment with her married boyfriend, Tony DeForrest. Coming home from shopping, Paula finds Tony gone as he had suddenly deserted her to travel to Italy for a film role. Prior to his departure (and unbeknownst to Paula), Tony sublet the apartment to Elliot Garfield (Richard Dreyfuss), a neurotic but sweet aspiring actor from Chicago, who shows up in the middle of the night expecting to move in. Paula, who is demanding, cynical, and neurotic, makes it clear from the start that she does not like Elliot, but reluctantly lets him move in. They argue about boundaries, with Elliot agreeing to allow Paula and Lucy to stay.\nPaula is struggling to get back into shape so she can resume her career as a dancer. Meanwhile, Elliot has landed the title role in an off-off-Broadway production of Richard III, but the director, Mark (Paul Benedict), wants him to play Richard III of England as an exaggerated homosexual stereotype\u2014in Mark's words, \"the queen who wanted to be king.\" Reluctantly, Elliot agrees to the non-traditional portrayal, despite knowing that it may mean the end of his acting career. Theater critics from numerous New York City television stations and newspapers attend opening night and savage the show, paying special attention to trashing Elliot's performance. The play quickly closes, much to his relief.\nDespite their frequent clashes and Paula's lack of gratitude for Elliot's help, the two fall in love and sleep together. Lucy, despite liking Elliot, grows cautious and sees the affair as a repeat of what happened with Tony. Elliot convinces Paula that he will not be a repeat of their experience with Tony; later he picks up Lucy from school and takes her on a carriage ride, during which the youngster admits she likes Elliot. In response, Elliot explains how much he cares for Lucy and Paula and that he would not do anything to hurt them.\nElliot lands a job at an improvisational theatre, and is soon seen by a well-known film director. He is offered an opportunity for a film role that he cannot turn down, but the job is in Seattle and Elliot will be gone for four weeks. Paula is scared that Elliot is leaving her, never to return, like all the other men in her life. Later, Elliot calls Paula from the phone booth across the street to say his flight was delayed, and at the last minute, he invites Paula to go with him while he is filming, suggesting Lucy stay with Paula's friend Donna until they return. Paula declines but is encouraged by Elliot's invitation. Before hanging up, Elliot asks Paula to restring his prized guitar (which he deliberately left at the apartment), and she realizes this proves he really does love her and will indeed return.\n\nCast\nRichard Dreyfuss as Elliot Garfield\nMarsha Mason as Paula McFadden\nQuinn Cummings as Lucy McFadden\nPaul Benedict as Mark Bodine\nBarbara Rhoades as Donna Douglas\nTheresa Merritt as Mrs. Crosby\nMichael Shawn as Ronnie Burns\nPatricia Pearcy as Rhonda Fontana\nNicol Williamson as Oliver Fry (uncredited)\n\nProduction\nThe film began as a screenplay called Bogart Slept Here (essentially the story of what happened to Dustin Hoffman after he became a star) that was to star Robert De Niro and Mason for Warner Bros. It would have been the film De Niro made immediately after Taxi Driver. Mike Nichols was hired to direct.Simon recalled the original idea for the film:\n\nThe basic idea of the story was that Marsha, an ex-dancer, was married to a very promising but struggling off-Broadway actor who gets discovered in a small play and is whisked out to Hollywood, where he reluctantly moves with his family. He feels very out of place there...and they have trouble adjusting, especially after his first film makes him an international star...and it creates chaos in their marriage. The story was coming out a little darker than I had imagined, but I envisioned the character of the wife as a very good role for Marsha.\nFilming began on Bogart Slept Here but it became apparent that De Niro was not right for the role. Simon recalled: \"...it was clear that any of the humor I had written was going to get lost. It's not that De Niro is not funny, but his humor comes mostly from his nuances, a bemused expression on his face or the way he would look at a character, smile and then look up at the ceiling.\" Nichols insisted on recasting De Niro. Soon after, Nichols left the project.Dreyfuss was brought in to audition with Mason. At the end of the reading, Simon decided the chemistry was there, but the script needed work. He rewrote the screenplay in six weeks.\n\n[The screenplay] had to be funnier, more romantic, the way Marsha and I first imagined the picture would be. What I wanted to do was a prequel. In other words, instead of an off-Broadway actor, married with a child, why don't I start from the beginning? I'd start when they first meet. Not liking each other at first and then falling in love.\nThe film's exteriors were filmed in New York City and the interiors were shot on sets in Los Angeles. Warner Bros. was less than enthused about Simon's script and considered selling the project to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, but the studio ultimately decided to partner with MGM on the film instead. With the 1996 acquisition of Turner Entertainment Company, which owned the pre-May 1986 MGM film library by Time Warner, Warner Bros. now owns the rights and distribution of the film.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe title song, \"Goodbye Girl\", was written and performed by David Gates in 1977, and was a top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1977/78, peaking at #15.\n\nReception\nRoger Ebert gave the film a mostly favorable review, awarding three stars out of four. He was unimpressed with Mason's performance and the character as written, calling it \"hardly ever sympathetic.\" However, he praised Dreyfuss and cited his Richard III scenes as \"the funniest in a movie since Mel Brooks staged Springtime for Hitler.\" Ebert criticized the beginning as \"awkward at times and never quite involving,\" but \"enjoyed its conclusion so much that we almost forgot our earlier reservations.\" Gene Siskel awarded an identical three-star grade and said, \"Make no mistake about it, the very best thing about 'The Goodbye Girl' is the character of Elliot Garfield as played by Dreyfuss, a character that comes very close to Dreyfuss' own self-and-profession centered lifestyle. But like Dreyfuss himself, Elliott Garfield, who initially comes off as [a] pushy, prickly type, ultimately wins you over.\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times found the film to be \"exhausting without being much fun\" and \"relentlessly wisecracked.\" Charles Champlin of The Los Angeles Times lauded it as \"the best and most blissfully satisfying romantic comedy of the year and then some.\" Arthur D. Murphy of Variety called the film \"another feather in Herbert Ross' directorial cap,\" with Dreyfuss giving \"his best screen performance to date.\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote that the film \"evolves into the most satisfying comedy Simon has written directly for the movies. One tolerates the plot mechanics for the sake of the genuinely amusing aspects of his script, the bright remarks and the distinctive or appealing character traits that provide good performers with live ammunition.\" Pauline Kael of The New Yorker was negative, commenting, \"It's not Neil Simon's one-liners that get you down in The Goodbye Girl, it's his two-liners. The snappiness of the exchanges is so forced it's almost macabre.\" David Ansen of Newsweek wrote, \"It's pure formula, and Simon plays it straight, all cards on the table, with the conservative professionalism of a gambler used to winning. As directed by the ubiquitous Herbert Ross, The Goodbye Girl is a modest, bittersweet comedy that will delight Simon fans and leave his critics staunchly unconverted.\"On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 80% of 25 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.8/10.\n\nAwards and nominations\nRichard Dreyfuss was 30 when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor, making him the youngest actor ever to win the category. This record stood for 25 years until 2002 when Adrien Brody\u2014just one month shy of his 30th birthday\u2014won for The Pianist.\nAmerican Film Institute\n\nAFI's 100 Years...100 Movies \u2013 Nominated\nAFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs \u2013 Nominated\nAFI's 100 Years...100 Passions \u2013 #81\nAFI's 100 Years...100 Songs:\nThe Goodbye Girl \u2013 Nominated\nAFI's 10 Top 10 \u2013 Nominated Romantic Comedy\n\nMusical and remake\nThere were three failed attempts to turn The Goodbye Girl into a half-hour, television sitcom, according to Lee Goldberg's book Unsold Television Pilots.

It runs from the Virginia state line, where the roadway continues east to Appalachia, Virginia as State Route 160, north via Lynch, Benham, Clutts, Cumberland, Sand Hill, Gordon, Linefork, Kings Creek, Premium, and Hot Spot to Kentucky Route 15 at Van. KY 160 overlaps KY 15 through Isom to Cody, where it splits to run via Carr Creek, Brinkley, and Hindman, ending at Kentucky Route 1087 at Vest. Due to the mountainous terrain and numerous tight bends. KY 160 is signposted closed to tractor-trailers from Lynch to the Virginia state line. \n\nKY 160 is part of the State Primary System from Virginia to the U.S. Highway 119 interchange in Cumberland, the State Secondary System from US 119 to KY 15 at Van and from KY 15 at Cody to Kentucky Route 80 north of Hindman, and the Rural Secondary System from KY 80 to KY 1087 at Vest.\n\nMajor intersections\nPassage 2:\nKentucky Route 686\nKentucky Route 686 (KY 686) is a 6.333-mile (10.192 km) state highway around the city of Mount Sterling, Kentucky. The route begins at Kentucky Route 11 and U.S. Route 460 north of the city and goes counter-clockwise, ending at U.S. Route 60 east of downtown. The western portion of the bypass from KY 11 south of the city to US 460 north of the city was completed in late 1985 as a four-lane highway. East of the southern junction with US 460 to the eastern terminus at US 60, KY 686 is a 2.827-mile (4.550 km) two-lane highway on a four-lane right-of-way and was completed in the early 2000s.\n\nRoute description\nKY 686 begins at an intersection with US 460/KY 11 in the northern part of Mount Sterling, heading west on four-lane divided Indian Mound Drive. The road passes through business areas, curving to the south. The route intersects KY 713 before coming to a junction with US 60. Past US 60, KY 686 heads through residential areas with some businesses, turning to the east. The road intersects KY 11 again and passes more development in the southern part of Mount Sterling before coming to another junction with US 460. Following this intersection, the route heads northeast into agricultural areas and narrows into a two-lane undivided road, crossing KY 713 again. KY 686 curves to the north and passes through more rural areas before heading near residential and commercial development and ending at another intersection with US 60 to the east of Mount Sterling.\n\nMajor intersections\nThe entire route is in Montgomery County.\nPassage 3:\nOldham County, Kentucky\nOldham County is a county located in the north central part of the U.S. state and commonwealth of Kentucky. As of the 2020 census, the population was 67,607. Its county seat is La Grange. The county is named for Colonel William Oldham.\nOldham County is part of the Louisville/Jefferson County, KY\u2013IN Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nOldham County is the wealthiest county in Kentucky and 47th-wealthiest county in the U.S. and ranks as the most educated county in Kentucky  While the causes for this are complicated, areas east of Louisville have long been popular with wealthy residents, initially as summer residences and eventually as year-round suburban estates and bedroom communities. Oldham County lies northeast of the best known of these areas, Anchorage, just outside Louisville's pre-merger East End.\n\nHistory\nOldham County was established on December 15, 1823, from parts of Henry, Jefferson, and Shelby Counties. It was the 74th Kentucky county, and was named in honor of Col. William Oldham of Jefferson County, a Revolutionary War officer.Initially, it was mainly a rural county with small, scattered developments in places like Westport which was founded in 1800 and served as the county seat early on. When the Louisville and Frankfort Railroad Company introduced rail lines in the area in the 1850s, many new towns and communities sprang up. Eventually the railroad ceased operating as a form of public transportation, but the more rural nature of the county continued to draw residents away from the metropolitan areas in Jefferson County. Since the early 1970s and the completion of Interstate 71, which connects Oldham County to Downtown Louisville and shopping in Eastern Jefferson County, Oldham County has increasingly become suburban in nature, a natural extension of Louisville's wealthy East End as it ran out of large tracts of undeveloped land.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 196 square miles (510 km2), of which 187 square miles (480 km2) are land and 9.2 square miles (24 km2) (4.7%) are covered by water. It is the 13th-smallest county in Kentucky. The county's northern border with Indiana is formed by the Ohio River.\n\nAdjacent counties\nClark County, Indiana (northwest)\nTrimble County (northeast)\nHenry County (east)\nShelby County (southeast)\nJefferson County (southwest)\n\nDemographics\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 46,178 people, 14,856 households, and 12,196 families residing in the county. The population density was 244 per square mile (94/km2). There were 15,541 housing units at an average density of 82 per square mile (32/km2). The racial makeup of the county was 93.62% White, 4.21% Black or African American, 0.21% Native American, 0.44% Asian, 0.01% Pacific Islander, 0.55% from other races, and 0.97% from two or more races. 1.30% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.\nThere were 14,856 households, out of which 44.10% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 71.50% were married couples living together, 7.80% had a female householder with no husband present, and 17.90% were non-families. 14.90% of all households were made up of individuals, and 4.80% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.85 and the average family size was 3.17.\nThe age distribution was 27.40% under the age of 18, 6.90% from 18 to 24, 33.10% from 25 to 44, 25.60% from 45 to 64, and 7.00% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 114.00 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 117.90 males.\nThe median income for a household in the county was $70,171 (2005), and the median income for a family was $70,495. Males had a median income of $46,962 versus $28,985 for females. The per capita income for the county was $25,374.  About 2.90% of families and 4.10% of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.50% of those under age 18 and 6.00% of those age 65 or over. Oldham County is the most affluent county in the state of Kentucky; most residents work in Louisville and choose to live in Oldham County due to the lack of crime and the nationally recognized school system. North Oldham High School in particular, is ranked very highly among state high schools, having been named a national blue ribbon school of excellence, and ranked in the top 250 best schools in the nation through US Weekly. 2006 classes at Oldham County High School were reported as to have a teacher:student ratio of 1:15, but that number does not accurately reflect the ratio of a normal class.  That number includes, for example, the small classes of five to six students in Behavioral Disorders.  The published ratio also includes small classes at the County Career Center, which is located on the same campus.  The actual teacher-student ratios are closer to 1:30. Regardless of population swelling and diminishing student-teacher ratios, which have led to a slight decline as of late, Oldham county is still widely recognized as the best public school system in the state.\n\nCommunities\nCities\nCensus-designated places\nBuckner\nWestport\n\nOther unincorporated places\nPolitics\nGovernment\nAt the federal level, Oldham County overlaps two congressional districts in the House of Representatives, the third district, represented by Democrat John Yarmuth, and the fourth district, represented by Republican Thomas Massie.\n\nNotable people\nD.

The highway, maintained by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, runs north from High Bridge, Kentucky through Wilmore before ending at Nicholasville. Within Wilmore, KY 29 intersects Kentucky Route 1268 and junctions with Kentucky Route 3433. The highway acts as the border between Asbury University and Asbury Theological Seminary. Just north of Wilmore, KY 29 merges with U.S. Route 68 for 0.590 miles (0.950 km) before leaving US 68 and turning east heading towards Nicholasville. KY 29 terminates at Kentucky Route 39 and U.S. Route 27 Business in downtown Nicholasville.\n\nRoute description\nKY 29 begins at an intersection with Lock Seven Road near the Kentucky River in High Bridge, Jessamine County, heading north on two-lane undivided High Bridge Road. The road heads through woodland with some homes and turns to the east, passing under a Norfolk Southern railroad line. The route continues through farmland with some woods and residences and curves to the northeast. KY 29 turns to the north and comes to a bridge over the railroad tracks. The road heads northeast through more rural areas before it enters Wilmore and becomes South Lexington Avenue. KY 29 passes homes before it runs past businesses and comes to an intersection with KY 1268. The road becomes North Lexington Avenue and runs between Asbury University to the west and Asbury Theological Seminary to the east. The route intersects the western terminus of KY 3433 and continues through residential areas. KY 29 leaves Wilmore and becomes Lexington Road, passing through farmland with some residential development. The route comes to an intersection with US 68 and forms a concurrency with that route on Harrodsburg Road.The road heads northeast and widens into a four-lane divided highway. KY 29 splits from US 68 by heading southeast on two-lane undivided Wilmore Road and continues through agricultural areas with some residential development. The road curves to the east and intersects the eastern terminus of KY 3433. The route heads into Nicholasville and widens to a divided highway as it comes to an interchange with US 27. KY 29 becomes undivided again and passes through residential and commercial areas, coming to another bridge over the Norfolk Southern line. The road becomes West Maple Street and runs past more homes before intersecting the southern terminus of KY 2332 and heading into the downtown area. KY 29 comes to its eastern terminus at an intersection with US 27 Bus., where the road continues east as KY 39.\n\nMajor intersections\nThe entire route is in Jessamine County.\nPassage 5:\nKentucky Route 3016\nKentucky Route 3016 (KY 3016) is a state highway in the Bluegrass region of Kentucky. The highway extends 2.082 miles (3.351 km) from KY 982 north to KY 36 and KY 356 in Cynthiana in central Harrison County. KY 3016 serves the south and west sides of the Harrison County seat. The highway was established north of U.S. Route 27 Business (US 27 Bus.) and KY 32 in 1987 and extended south to KY 982 in 2014.\n\nRoute description\nKY 3016 begins at KY 982 (New Lair Road) just north of that highway's bridge across the South Fork Licking River at the south city limit of Cynthiana. The highway heads northwest along Safety Way and veers onto Ladish Road just east of its bridge across the South Fork Licking River. West of the river, KY 3016 turns northeast onto Paris Pike, on which the highway runs concurrently with US 27 Bus. and KY 32. The route splits onto Old Leesburg Pike, which crosses and then parallels Grays Run and Paris Pike, which runs along the south side of Grays Run on its way to its river crossing and downtown Cynthiana. At Grays Run's confluence with the South Fork Licking River, KY 3016 curves north onto River Road, which the route follows to its northern terminus at a five-way intersection with KY 36, KY 356, and White Oak Pike. KY 36 heads east along Pleasant Street into downtown Cynthiana and north on Williamstown Road, and KY 356 heads west on Pleasant Street. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet classifies KY 3016 as a state secondary highway along its independent course; its concurrency with US 27 Bus. and KY 32 is a state primary highway.\n\nHistory\nThe Kentucky Transportation Cabinet established KY 3016 as a rural secondary highway between Paris Pike, which then included mainline US 27, and Pleasant Street through a May 4, 1987, official order. The agency reclassified the highway as a state secondary highway via an October 19, 2004, official order. The cabinet extended KY 3016 south from US 27 along Ladish Road and Safety Way to KY 982 after an August 5, 2014, official order. The highway's overlap with US 27 became one with US 27 Business after the mainline U.S. Highway was placed on the Cynthiana Bypass as ordered December 10, 2014.\n\nMajor intersections\nThe entire route is in Cynthiana, Harrison County.\nPassage 6:\nKentucky Route 393\nKentucky Route 393 (KY 393) is a 5.325-mile-long (8.570 km) state highway in Oldham County, Kentucky, that runs from Kentucky Route 1818 southeast of Centerfield to U.S. Route 42 north of Buckner.\n\nRoute description\nIts northern terminus is US 42.  From there it continues 5.5 miles (8.9 km) south to a 0.04-mile (0.064 km) overlap with KY 146 in Buckner.  It then splits south to continue for 2.5 miles (4.0 km) where it junctions KY 22 near Centerfield.  It follows KY 22 east for 1-mile (1.6 km) until it splits to the south.  It continues 1.5 miles (2.4 km) south and then terminates at Mount Zion Road.  There are no low clearances or weight limits on this particular state route. As of 2009, this route has been relocated and improved.  From the interchange of Interstate 71, it has been widened to three lanes with a center turn lane.  It has been improved to the junction of State Route 22.\n\nMajor intersections\nThe entire route is in Oldham County.\nPassage 7:\nKentucky Route 155\nKentucky Route 155 (KY 155) is a 20.788-mile-long (33.455 km) state highway in the U.S. state of Kentucky. The route originates at a junction with U.S. Route 31E and US 150 (Bardstown Road) in Louisville, Kentucky. On the other side of intersection, KY 155 becomes a local road called Trevilian Way. KY 155 continues through several Louisville suburbs to Jeffersontown, Kentucky and into Spencer County, where it eventually merges with Kentucky Route 55 a few miles north of Taylorsville, Kentucky.\nIt is known locally as Taylorsville Road from its northern terminus until a junction with Kentucky Route 148 in Jefferson County, where it is known as Taylorsville Lake Road until reaching its southern terminus. Despite what its two local names would suggest, KY 155 itself does not actually reach either Taylorsville Lake or Taylorsville, but through connecting roads it is the primary non-interstate link between Louisville and both of those locations.\nIt is 4 to 6 lanes through much of Jefferson County, and is a major thoroughfare connecting Louisville's inner east side neighborhoods with suburban shopping and business areas, such as the Hurstbourne Parkway corridor. It interchanges with both I-264 and I-265.\n\nHistory\nKY 155's history is relatively lengthy, the intersection with Bardstown Road (once called the Bardstown Turnpike) was originally known as Doup's Point, the home of a major Louisville family. In 1848 legislation was passed authorizing the construction of a spur route from the Bardstown Turnpike near Doup's Point to Taylorsville, by way of Jeffersontown. The route, initially called the Louisville and Taylorsville Pike, was completed by the late 19th century and was expanded to 4 lanes in the 1960s. In the early 1990s, as a part of improvements to I-264 and its interchanges, KY 155 was widened to 6 lanes south of the interchange and local access roads were built parallel to it, to provide easier access for residents whose driveways had previously opened onto the highway.\n\nMajor intersections\nSee also\nRoads in Louisville, Kentucky\nPassage 8:\nKentucky Route 28\nKentucky Route 28 (KY 28) is a 36.217-mile-long (58.286 km) state highway in the U.S. state of Kentucky that travels from KY 11 and KY 30 in Booneville to KY 15 in northern rural Perry County via Cow Creek, Arnett, Buckhorn, and Chavies. KY 28 begins in Booneville by traveling concurrently with KY 30 east while KY 30 west travels through town to the northwest. KY 30 veers off at the official beginning of KY 28 at Mulberry Street. KY 28 heads out of Booneville in Owsley County, heading southeast. About 11 miles (18 km) southeast of Booneville, KY 28 enters Breathitt County. After about 6 miles (9.7 km) through Breathitt County, KY 28 enters Perry County. KY 28 passes through the community of Buckhorn before making a short reentry into Breathitt County. After returning to Perry County, KY 28 passes through the community of Chavies before ending at KY 15 at Grapevine in Perry County.\n\nMajor intersections\nOwsley County + Breathitt County = 18.154\n\nSee also\n U.S. Roads portal\n United States portal\nPassage 9:\nKentucky Route 93\nKentucky Route 93 (KY 93) is a 27.734-mile (44.634 km) state highway in western Kentucky.\n\nRoute description\nThe route is separated into two segments. The southern segment runs from Kentucky Routes 139 and 276 southeast of the unincorporated community of Lamasco to Kentucky Route 810, Kentucky Route 819, and Iuka Ferry Road northwest of \nKuttawa via Lamasco, Confederate, and Eddyville. The northern segment runs from Kentucky Route 917 and Short Drive just east of Iuka to Kentucky Route 453 in rural Livingston County several miles east of Iuka via Iuka. It appears that the two segments were originally or meant to be connected, as both segments are just a few miles apart. It appears that they were to connect at the Cumberland River, at which the northern segment ends on the western bank and a rural road, likely what was or is to be part of KY 93, ends on the east bank.\n\nHistory\nKY 93 previously ran from the Tennessee State line in Trigg County to Fredonia via Cadiz, Eddyville and Kuttawa. KY 93 north of Eddyville is now US 641, while the highway from the Lyon-Caldwell-Trigg County tripoint southward is now signed as KY 139. \nKY 93 was reassigned to US 62's old alignment west of Kuttawa to Iuka via the now-discontinued ferry service when US 62 was reallocated to a new alignment providing a more-direct route to Paducah in the mid-1950s.\n\nMajor intersections\nPassage 10:\nKentucky Route 1065\nKentucky Route 1065 (KY 1065) is a 13.856-mile-long (22.299 km) state highway located in Louisville, Kentucky. The western terminus of the route is at Kentucky Route 907 a short distance west of Kentucky Route 841 (Gene Snyder Freeway) exit 6 in the Louisville neighborhood of Auburndale. The eastern terminus is at Kentucky Route 1819 in Fern Creek.\nThe route is known as the Outer Loop, Beulah Church Road, Seatonville Road, and Lovers Lane. It passes by what was the Louisville Motor Speedway and intersects Interstate 65 and the U.S. Route 31E/U.S. Route 150 concurrency.\n\nRoute description\nKY 1065 begins at an intersection with KY 907 in the Auburndale section of Louisville, heading east on two-lane undivided Outer Loop. The road crosses a CSX railroad line and heads between homes to the north and commercial establishments to the south. The route passes near shopping centers and comes to an intersection with KY 1865. KY 1065 continues through wooded areas with some nearby homes and commercial areas, reaching the KY 1020 junction. Past this, the route becomes a four-lane divided highway and heads through areas of businesses and industry, coming to a bridge over a CSX railroad line. The road passes through more industrial areas and heads to the south of a landfill as a four-lane undivided road before becoming a divided highway again as it comes to an interchange with I-65.  Past this interchange, KY 1065 passes near residential neighborhoods prior to reaching an intersection with KY 61 in a commercial area. The road continues east past several shopping centers and passes to the south of Jefferson Mall. The route heads through residential areas with some businesses and intersects the southern terminus of KY 2052.\n\nKY 1065 becomes a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane and heads east through more suburban development. The route curves northeast and intersects KY 864, at which point it turns southeast to form a concurrency with that route on Beulah Church Road. The road curves east, and KY 864 splits to the south. KY 1065 continues east on two-lane Beulah Church Road and passes through wooded residential neighborhoods, curving to the northeast. The route turns east and comes to an intersection with US 31E/US 150. Past this intersection, the road becomes Seatonville Road and heads east through more wooded areas of homes.

Amongst other motor racing events, it has hosted the German Grand Prix, most recently in 2019. The circuit has very little differences in elevation. The circuit has an FIA Grade 1 license.\n\nHistory\n1932\u20131938\nOriginally called \"Dreieckskurs\" (triangle course), the Hockenheimring was built in 1932. The man behind it is Ernst Christ, a young timekeeper who felt that a racing track should be built in his hometown of Hockenheim. He submitted the plans to the mayor and they were approved on Christmas day, in 1931. This first layout of the track was around twelve kilometres long and consisted of a large triangle-like section, a hairpin in the city and two straights connecting them.\n\n1938\u20131965\nIn 1938, the circuit dramatically shortened, from twelve kilometres down to just over seven and a half, and the Ostkurve corner, which lasted until 2001, was introduced for the first time.  In that year, the track was also renamed to \"Kurpfalzring\".  The track was damaged by tanks during World War II. After the war, the track was repaired, and renamed to \"Hockenheimring\". Former DKW and NSU factory rider and world record setter Wilhelm Herz became the manager of the track in 1954 and promoted the track successfully; Grand Prix motorcycle racing events were held, with the German motorcycle Grand Prix alternating between the Hockenheimring and other tracks.  This version of the circuit was just over seven and a half kilometres long and consisted of the original two long straights, with the Ostkurve in the forest and the original hairpin inside Hockenheim joining them together.\n\n1965\u20132001\nIn 1965, when the new Autobahn A 6 separated the village from the main part of the track, a new version of Hockenheim circuit was built, with the \"Motodrom\" stadium section, designed by John Hugenholtz, who also designed Suzuka. After Jim Clark was killed on 7 April 1968 in a Formula 2 racing accident, two fast chicanes were added and the track was lined with crash barriers in 1970. A small memorial was placed near the first chicane (which was named after him), at the site of his accident. In 1982, another chicane was added at the Ostkurve (east curve), after Patrick Depailler was killed there in 1980, and the first chicane was made slower as well. For the 1992 German Grand Prix, the Ostkurve was changed yet again, from a quick left turn into a more complex right-left-right chicane, after \u00c9rik Comas crashed there in 1991. The second chicane was renamed after Ayrton Senna, after his death at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.\nThis version used to be quite large, with a very long and very fast section going through forests essentially consisting of four straights of roughly 1.3 km (0.81 mi), separated by a chicane sequence, followed by a more tight and twisty \"stadium\" section (so called because of all the grandstands situated there) named Motodrom. This made the setting up of racing cars difficult, since a choice had to be made \u2013 whether to run low downforce to optimize speed through the straights and compromise grip in the stadium section, or vice versa. The long track length also meant that a typical Formula One race had only 45 laps, limiting the spectators' experience of the race to only that many passes through the stadium.\nDuring the mid-1980s \"turbo era\" of Formula One where fuel was restricted to either 220 (1984\u20131985), 195 (1986\u20131987) or 150 (1988) litres for races for the turbo powered cars, Hockenheim also saw drivers, including World Champion Alain Prost, at times fail to finish due to simply running out of fuel near the end of the race. Prost ran out at the end of the 1986 race, pushing his McLaren towards the line before giving up. He was placed 3rd when he ran dry and was eventually classified 6th, gaining a valuable championship point that would help him with his second World Championship.\n\nMany problems came to light during the 2000 German Grand Prix, which was won by Brazilian driver Rubens Barrichello from having started 18th on the grid. The race finished in changeable weather conditions, with pouring rain in the stadium sector and almost completely dry forest straights. All the overtaking moves that took place during the race were in the chicanes of the forest sector, meaning hardly any spectators saw most of the best action. Midway through the race, a former Mercedes-Benz employee, who had been dismissed, breached the track's security barriers on the first forest straight, showing vulnerable security facilities in the forest and leading to the deployment of the safety car that neutralized a comfortable lead for the two Mercedes-powered McLarens. Later on, French driver Jean Alesi collided with Brazilian Pedro Diniz in the braking zone for the third chicane and his car spun uncontrollably down the track, which caused him to suffer dizziness for three days.\nThese events prompted much protest from the FIA to greatly improve spectator viewing, safety, and security at the track, claiming that the track was no longer suited to modern Formula One racing.\n\n2002 redesign\nIn the early 2000s, F1 officials demanded the 6.823 km (4.240 mi) track be shortened and threatened to discontinue racing there, threatening to relocate to other tracks such as the EuroSpeedway Lausitz and sites in Asia. The state government of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg secured the financing for the redesign by Hermann Tilke for the 2002 German Grand Prix. The stadium section remained mostly intact, despite a new surface and a tighter Turn 1 (\"Nordkurve\"). However, the circuit was dramatically shortened, with the long, forested straights section chopped off in favour of more tight corners. More than half of the first straight and almost all of the straight between the Ostkurve and Senna chicane were cut and the rest was connected with a new long straight called the \"Parabolika\", with a small kink being added between the first straight and the new one. A small right-left-right complex was added to the remaining part of the final straight, with a new grandstand overlooking it. In an extremely controversial move, the old forest section was torn up and replanted with trees, eliminating any chance of using the old course either for future F1 events or for historic car events.\nThere was and still remains a great deal of criticism of the track redesign, in terms of ruining the previous unique technical challenges of the old Hockenheim circuit and delivering a new homogenised \"assembly line\" circuit without the character of the previous layout, whilst being beset by the perceived problems of other Tilke circuits. Several drivers and team principals, including Ron Dennis, Jarno Trulli and Juan Pablo Montoya, criticised the changes and stated their preference for the old circuit.The change in the track layout also saw the installation of a new memorial to Jim Clark. This is located at the outside of the current track's turn 2, where the old track continued out into the forests, and the new shortened track turns to the right.The new track has a seating capacity of 120,000, due to new large grandstands sponsored by Mercedes-Benz. The complex also features a quarter-mile track for drag racing. It hosts one of the largest drag racing events in Europe, known as the NitrOlympx, and was one of the last Top Fuel circuits to race to 0.25 miles (0.40 km) before the FIA switched the nitro categories to the now-recognised 1,000 feet (300 m) distance in 2012.\n\nFormula One\nThe Hockenheim Circuit hosted the German Grand Prix for the first time in 1970 when the F1 drivers decided at the French Grand Prix to boycott the allegedly dangerous N\u00fcrburgring unless major changes were made. The next year the German Grand Prix went back to the N\u00fcrburgring until the 1976 German Grand Prix. From 1977 to 2006, the Hockenheimring hosted the German Grand Prix with the exception of 1985, when the race was held at the reconfigured N\u00fcrburgring.\nIn July 2006, Bernie Ecclestone announced that from 2007 onwards, there would be only one Grand Prix per year in Germany. Since 1995, there had been two Grands Prix every year in Germany; the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, plus either the European Grand Prix or the Luxembourg Grand Prix at the N\u00fcrburgring. From 2007, the N\u00fcrburgring and Hockenheimring alternated hosting the German Grand Prix, starting with the N\u00fcrburgring in 2007.\n\nOngoing deficits of the Formula One races, amounting to up to 5.3 million Euro per race that had to be covered by the local communities, made it likely the contract between the Hockenheimring and Formula One Management would not be extended after the Grand Prix of 2010. However, in October 2009 the contract for the circuit to hold the German GP was extended to 2018, with the FOA agreeing to cover any losses the event incurs. Neither Hockenheim nor the N\u00fcrburgring hosted a Grand Prix in 2015 or 2017 after the N\u00fcrburgring failed to complete an agreement with Formula 1's commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone.\n\nDrag racing (NitrolympX \u2013 Rico Anthes Quartermile)\nFrom 1986 to 1988, the start\u2013finish straight was used for 1/8 mile drag racing. In 1989, a proper drag strip was built by connecting the Opel-Kurve and the first turn entering the Motodrom section. The finish line was at the beginning of the forest, with a very long run-off on the straight in the forest. Competitors had to travel around the full race track in opposite direction to return to the paddock.\nThe drag strip is only used for two events in August, the Public Race Days and the NitrolympX main event a week later. Originally named the Nitrolympics and featuring Top Fuel dragsters, it was renamed to NitrolympX.\nWhen the Hockenheimring was shortened in 2002, the drag strip was moved back, closer to the new tall Tower stands that allow an unusual view along the drag strip. Even though the run off was cut in half it remains one of the longest in drag racing. The NitrolympX usually host most European Drag Racing Championship, sanctioned by FIA or FIM, plus jet dragsters and other entertaining events on the Saturday night show that draws 40,000 spectators.The drag strip in 2008 was christened Rico Anthes Quartermile after the German former Top Fuel driver and long-time organizer of the NitrolympX had retired in 2007. As the dragstrip can only be prepared for professional drag racing after the last major circuit event, mainly the Formula One race, the grip is often sub par compared to permanent drag strips that host two Euro Championship events each year, like Santa Pod Raceway in England or Tierp Arena in Sweden. The best performances on the full quarter-mile were significantly below those in Santa Pod, and the best ET was set in 2005: 4.873 sec. and 458 km/h by Brady Kalivoda (USA).In 2012, some Pro classes could not find traction as Formula One had demanded a new surface. In subsequent years, the organizers provided a better track, with support from Santa Pod personnel and machinery. In 2016, Hockenheim, and mainland Europe, finally saw the first 3-second Top Fuel 1000 ft passes, with 3.939 sec. and 486.91 km/h by Anita M\u00e4kel\u00e4 (FIN). An overall European record for Super Street Bike was set by Garry Bowe (GB) with 7.04s 340,69 km/h.\n\nDTM\nThe DTM (Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters) series has regularly raced at the Hockenheimring since its revival in 2000. In most years, the DTM has competed there twice during a season.\n\nRallycross\nLocated in the stadia section of the track, the rallycross track uses a section of track from turns 11 to 16, combined with a dirt section in front of the grandstands. It hosted first ever World RX of Hockenheim, round 2 of FIA World Rallycross Championship in 2015 as supporting event of DTM. WRX also combined with the DTM for an event there in 2017.\n\nLayout history\nCurrent circuit configurations\nPrevious configurations\nLap records\nOfficial record lap times are only set during the race. The fastest ever lap on the track is 1:11.212 set by Sebastian Vettel in a Ferrari SF71H during qualifying at the 2018 German Grand Prix.

He regularly played football as a child, and attended Portones Primary School and Jose Pedro Varela High School.\nPassage 3:\nCristian Jeandet\nCristian Daniel Jeandet (born March 1, 1975) is a retired Argentine football striker. He retired in December 2015 after playing in 23 clubs and in the top-leagues of eight different countries: Argentina, Italy, FR Yugoslavia, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Morocco and Venezuela. He is regarded along Lutz Pfannenstiel and Sebasti\u00e1n Abreu among the best known globetrotters.\n\nCareer\nBeginnings and Newell's\nBorn in Concordia, Entre R\u00edos, Argentina, he started playing in local side Estudiantes Concordia when he was 12.  By his own words, he scored 60 goals in 23 games in first year, and 73 goals in 36 games in next one, receiving, an award as the recognition of the record of goals in youth levels, by then, at the city of Paran\u00e1, Entre R\u00edos. After that, Newell's Old Boys coach, Marcelo Bielsa, took him after trials. Jeandet spent 6 years at youth levels of Newell's, reaching promotion to the first team but without ever debuting in the league. Then what followed were loans, first six months to Ferrocaril de Concordia playing at Torneo Argentino A in 1995\u201396, but failed to qualify to final stage of the tournament, and next to same level club Patronato, in 1996\u201397, reaching with them the semi-finals.\n\nEurope: Italy and Yugoslavia\nAfter the loans at Argentino A, Jeandet left Newell's and joined Lan\u00fas.  He faced tough competition for a spot in the team from older and more experienced Claudio Enr\u00eda and Ariel \"Chupa\" L\u00f3pez. He failed to debut in the league, so he left, this time moving abroad, crossing the Atlantic, and settling in Italy. First he played with Fidelis Andria, competing in Serie B at that time, and making 4 appearances. Next, he played with Casertana F.C. and Fidenza.  He experienced difficulties adapting, so he decided during the winter-break of 1999\u20132000 to cross the Adriatic and join Serbian side Sartid Smederevo playing back then in the First League of FR Yugoslavia. He stayed six months in Yugoslavia, leaving Sartid at the end of the season. In between, he also apent some time in Switzerland with FC Lugano.\n\nBack to South America\nAfter leaving Sartid, Jeandet crossed back the Atlantic, but instead of returning to his native Argentina, he went to Chile where he joined Palestino. There were three more Argentinian players in the club and Jeandet adapted well, however not long afterwards, the club changed the coach and Argentinian Ricardo Dabrowski was brought, who said Jeandet was not in his plans. That meant the end of the short spell at Palestino in Chile, and Jeandet returned to Argentina. Dalcio Giovagnoli informed him about the ambitious project Central C\u00f3rdoba was having under way at the time. Several Jeandet's former colleagues from Newell's were also playing at that time at the club, and Jeandet spent a solid 2000\u201301 season with Central C\u00f3rdoba. They reached the \"octogonal\" with Jeandet scoring 9 goals in the process, but were eliminated in the 1/8 finals by Instituto de C\u00f3rdoba which were strong and coached by Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino. Jeandet moved precisely to Instituto for the next season, but with Tito Martino already gone, and not getting many chances as a starter in the line-up, Jeandet opted to leave as soon as a good offer from Bolivian side Blooming arrived through his agent.\n\nPeru\nThe arrival to a major Bolivian club looked initially promising, however the club at the time was experiencing major difficulties. After three months at Blooming the situation became unsustainable; several coaches changed and the players were receiving no salaries and were on strike. Jeandet decided to leave, and left Bolivia and moved to Peru where he joined Club Aurora. He stayed at Aurora six very important months for the club, since Jeandet was crucial in the squad from Cochabamba that won the 2002 Copa Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar thus earning promotion after 14 years to the Liga de F\u00fatbol Profesional Boliviano, the national top tier. Jeandet scored two goals in the decisive victory of Aurora over Fancesa by 5\u20131.Next, he joined Peruvian top-league side Sport Boys where he played coached by his compatriot Jorge Sampaoli during 2003. At the time his daughter Catalina was about to born, his wife wanted to have her in Argentina. By that time, Jeandet was approached by Cienciano president with an offer to join the club and become their main striker in their upcoming Copa Sudamericana campaign, but with Jeandet disbelief of Cienciano doing well in the Copa, and the disadvantage of that meaning a move to Cusco, Peru, over his wife's desire to return to Argentina, Jeandet dropped the offer from Cienciano and joined Argentinian side Gimnasia y Esgrima. Playing in the Primera B Nacional, they finished the season relegated. Besides the bad sporting result, the club also failed to pay the last six salaries, which meant also a bad financial decision for him, and to make the bad choice even harder, Cienciano surprisingly won the Copa Sudamericana that season, and consequently, the Recopa Sudamericana as well.\n\nGlobetrotter: Morocco and Venezuela\nAfter this disastrous decision, Jeandet was decided to reanimate his career. After spells at Sarmiento de Junin and Estudiantes de Buenos Aires he moved again abroad. After trials in Austria, he joined in 2007, along Claudio Ortiz, Wydad Casablanca, becoming the first Argentinians to play in the Moroccan top league, the Botola. He played with Wydad in the CAF Champions League. The African adventure was followed by a trip to Venezuela where he played with Mineros de Guayana.\n\nBack to Argentina\nAfter Venezuela, he returned to Argentina and in the following years he had spells with Villa D\u00e1lmine, Sarmiento de Leones, Almagro, Deportivo Laferrere, Uni\u00f3n Aconquija, General Paz Juniors, Talleres de Perico and Sarmiento Leones.\n\nPersonal life\nCriistian Jeandet has four children, the older one, Catalina, then Constanza, Jerem\u00edas and Felipe. By spring 2014, Jerem\u00edas was playing football in Belgrano as striker.\n\nHonors\nAuroraCopa Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar: 2002Individual:\n\nTorneo Argentino B top-scorer: 2012\u201313 (22 goals)\nPassage 4:\nJonathan Blanes\nJonathan Blanes N\u00fa\u00f1ez (born March 10, 1987 in Paysand\u00fa) is a Uruguayan professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for River Plate in the Uruguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n.\n\nHonours\nClub\nRacing Club2007-2008 Uruguayan Segunda Divisi\u00f3n championship\nPassage 5:\nJonathan Urretaviscaya\nJonathan Mat\u00edas Urretaviscaya da Luz (born 19 March 1990) is a Uruguayan professional footballer who plays for Boston River as a right winger.\n\nClub career\nBorn in Montevideo to a father of Basque descent, Urretaviscaya started off his career with hometown's Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate. His Primera Divisi\u00f3n debut came one month shy of his 18th birthday as he scored in a 2\u20130 win against Liverpool Montevideo in the Clausura's first game, and he eventually netted nine goals overall for the runners-up.Urretaviscaya signed a contract with Portuguese club S.L. Benfica on 2 July 2008, for a fee of \u20ac1.5 million, being rarely used in his debut season. In January 2010, after having made almost no official appearances during the campaign \u2013 his only Primeira Liga game was against FC Porto as his team had many players missing due to injuries and suspensions, and he put up a good performance in a 1\u20130 home win for the eventual champions\u2013 he was loaned to Pe\u00f1arol for five months, thus returning to his country.In late June 2010, Urretaviscaya was loaned to Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a in a season-long move. In the following transfer window, however, he returned to Pe\u00f1arol in the same situation.For 2011\u201312, Urretaviscaya returned to Portugal, being loaned to Vit\u00f3ria S.C. while also renewing his contract until 2015.

Pachuca in the Mexican Liga MX.\n\nInternational career\nUrretaviscaya was part of the Uruguayan squad that competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics, held in London. He earned his first cap for the full side on 28 March 2017: after having come on as a second-half substitute for Carlos S\u00e1nchez, he received two yellow cards in 11 minutes and was thus sent off, in a 2\u20131 away loss to Peru for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.On 2 June 2018, Urretaviscaya was selected for the finals in Russia by manager \u00d3scar Tab\u00e1rez.

He is the current manager of Peruvian club Universidad C\u00e9sar Vallejo.\nHe is best known for his record of appearing for 32 teams in 11 countries during his professional career. Nicknamed Loco (Madman in Spanish), the prolific scorer for club and national team initially retired in 2021 after a four-month stint with Sud Am\u00e9rica, but later that same year came out of retirement with Olimpia de Minas.A Uruguayan international for more than 15 years, Abreu represented his country in two World Cups and three Copa Am\u00e9rica tournaments, winning the latter in 2011.\n\nPlaying career\nClub\nEarly career\nBorn in Minas, Lavalleja Department, Abreu played in numerous clubs throughout the Americas (Uruguay, Argentina, Mexico and Brazil). He also had an unsuccessful stint with Spain's Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a, which loaned him several times for the duration of his contract.In his sole season in La Liga, which started in January 1998, having been signed from San Lorenzo, Abreu scored for the Galicians in a 3\u20131 home defeat of Barcelona on 25 January.\n\nRiver Plate and Beitar\nAfter having joined Mexico's UANL in 2007, Abreu was able to rescind his contract with them in order to join River Plate \u2013 the Mexican Football Federation stalled on recognising the transfer because of an imposed moratorium between the clubs. He became the only foreigner to score in the Cl\u00e1sico Regiomontano (Tigres vs. Monterrey, which he represented the previous year) against each team.In the middle of 2008, after exhausting negotiations, Abreu signed a deal with Israeli League champions Beitar Jerusalem. He appeared in the qualifying rounds of the UEFA Champions League, but his team was quickly eliminated. Additionally, he could not play in the domestic front due to lack of payment.\nAbreu re-signed with River Plate in September 2008 after terminating his link with Beitar, with a deal lasting until June 2009. Due to being a late addition, he was not able to play for the side in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n, only featuring in the Copa Sudamericana. The next year, he was eligible for both the domestic and Copa Libertadores fronts.\n\nReal Sociedad\nIn early January 2009, Abreu returned to Spain after a ten-year absence, being loaned by River to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n side Real Sociedad, which had lost habitual first choice I\u00f1igo D\u00edaz de Cerio for the season due to a serious leg injury.On 14 March 2009, he scored a hat-trick in a 3\u20131 away win against league leaders Xerez. His team, however, ultimately failed in returning to the top flight.\n\nBotafogo\nOn 13 June 2009, Aris in Greece signed Abreu from River Plate. However, in January of the following year, the 33-year-old changed club and country again, agreeing on a two-year contract with Brazil's Botafogo.Abreu scored the second goal in the 2\u20131 victory over Flamengo on 18 April 2010, which gave the team the Campeonato Carioca title. In July, he had his link extended until 31 December 2012 with a release clause of US$11.3 million, with the player declaring he had previously held talks with Universidad de Chile and Trabzonspor of Turkey.On 6 February 2011, Abreu was involved in a dramatic match against Fluminense: his team won a penalty kick as they were losing 2\u20131, and he shot it in Panenka-style, with Diego Cavalieri saving the shot by simply standing still. Another penalty was awarded just five minutes later, and he shot it in the same fashion, this time into the right-hand corner of the goal, as the goalkeeper dived the other way; a few minutes later, Botafogo scored again and won the game.Abreu was loaned to fellow S\u00e9rie A side Figueirense on 5 July 2012. However, as the season went on to end in relegation, his contract was ended via Twitter on 24 November, one day before the last game against Gr\u00eamio.\n\nSol de Am\u00e9rica\nFrom January 2013 to December 2015, Abreu was under contract to Nacional, also being loaned to Rosario Central and Aucas during this timeframe. On 28 December 2015, Paraguayan newspaper D10 reported that he had met in Uruguay with Sol de Am\u00e9rica chairman Miguel Figueredo.

He made his debut for the national side on 17 July 1996 in a friendly with China, going on to earn 70 caps.On 27 May 2010, Abreu stood only five goals short of Uruguayan all-time goalscoring record, held by H\u00e9ctor Scarone for 79 years. He was selected for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, where he appeared three times as a substitute; in the quarter-finals against Ghana he scored the decisive penalty shootout attempt (1\u20131 after 120 minutes), a Panenka to send his team to the semi-finals for the first time in 40 years.\n\nCoaching career\nOn 26 April 2019, Abreu was announced as the interim manager of Santa Tecla on an initial one-and-a-half month spell, with the parties holding the option open of keeping him as a player-coach or just as a player afterwards. He won the Copa El Salvador four days later, defeating Audaz 1\u20130 in the final.In December 2019, Abreu was appointed player-coach at Boston River ahead of the upcoming campaign in the Uruguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n. He resigned from the last-placed club the following 9 November.Abreu was named manager of Bolivian Primera Divisi\u00f3n side Always Ready on 30 January 2022.

The structure is alternatively known as Cowie Chapel.\nThe chapel is at the point where the Highland Boundary Fault meets the sea and so is on the dividing line between the highlands and lowlands of Scotland.\n\nArea history\nThe Chapel of St. Mary and St. Nathalan is one of the oldest surviving structures in Kincardineshire.  About one kilometre to the west is the ancient Causey Mounth trackway, which was constructed on high ground to make passable this only available medieval route from coastal points south of Stonehaven into Aberdeen. This route specifically connected the River Dee crossing (where the present Bridge of Dee is situated) via Muchalls Castle and Cowie Castle from the south. (Hogan, 2007) The route was that taken by William Keith, 7th Earl Marischal and the Marquess of Montrose when they led a Covenanter army of 9000 men in the battle of the Civil War in 1639.\n\nSee also\nDoonie Point\nLimpet Burn\nRed Cloak\nPassage 2:\nInverallochy Castle\nInverallochy Castle is a ruined courtyard castle, near the village of Inverallochy in the Buchan area of North-East Scotland, dating to 1504. It lies 0.5 miles (0.80 km) south of Cairnbulg Castle, near Fraserburgh, and formerly stood beside the now-drained Loch of Inverallochy. It was described by W. Douglas Simpson as one of the nine castles of the Knuckle, referring to the rocky headland of North-East Aberdeenshire.\n\nDescription\nThe remains of buildings are arranged around three sides of a courtyard, with a curtain wall across the south side. A tower in the north-east corner remains largely to its full height, while the remaining curtain wall stands up to 10 m high. The internal walls have largely collapsed. Evidence of a larger outer courtyard measuring approximately 60 metres (200 ft) square to the north and east remains. The ruins are protected as a scheduled monument. The castle appears to have all been built at once, and architectural evidence suggests an early 16th-century date. It may have been the work of Sir William Comyn (or Cumyng) of Inverallochy, who was Lord Lyon in 1512\u20131519.\n\nInscribed stone\nUntil the latter half of the 18th century, there was a stone inserted above the entrance, bearing the sculptured arms of the Comyns, with an inscription \"recording that the estate around it was obtained by Jordan Comyn for building the abbey of Deer\".\nPassage 3:\nCowie Bridge\nCowie Bridge is a roadway bridge which carries the B979 across the mouth of the Cowie Water in Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, Scotland.  \nHistorically, the area in the vicinity of the Cowie Bridge site has been an old fishing village known as Cowie Village.  Between the Cowie Bridge and the North Sea, a new pedestrian bridge is planned, which will also support a new pipeline structure.  The site of Cowie Bridge is approximately the point of the southern terminus of the Causey Mounth trackway, which was the only available medieval route crossing the coastal Grampian Mountains northerly by way of Muchalls Castle and Gillybrands.\n\nSee also\nCowie Castle\nChapel of St. Mary and St. Nathalan\nPassage 4:\nAllardice Castle\nAllardice Castle (also spelled Allardyce) is a sixteenth-century manor house in Kincardineshire, Scotland. It is approximately 1.5 kilometres north-west of the town of Inverbervie.  The Bervie Water flows around Allardice Castle on both sides. Allardice may be viewed as one of a chain of coastal castles; to the north are Dunnottar Castle (ruined), Fetteresso Castle, Cowie Castle (ruined) and Muchalls Castle. The castle is a category A listed building. Allardice castle was the chief seat of the Barons of Allardice, an ancient family who first appear in an 1197 charter. Since 1542 (the time at which the current L-plan building was built) many alterations and changes have been made to the original structure.\nPassage 5:\nStonehaven Bay\nStonehaven Bay is a natural harbour in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The town of Stonehaven is built along the shore of Stonehaven Bay. The mouths of the Carron Water and the Cowie Water are both situated in Stonehaven, within the Bay.\nPassage 6:\nBervie Water\nBervie Water (Scottish Gaelic: Uisge Bhiorbhaigh) is a river in Aberdeenshire, Scotland which rises in the Drumtochty Forest and flows across The Mearns to reach the North Sea at Inverbervie.  Approximately two kilometres upstream of the North Sea, the Bervie Water flows through the grounds of Allardice Castle.  The Bothenoth Burn (Burn of Healing) joins the Bervie Water to the east of Arbuthnott House. At Arbuthnott the river forms a steep-sided valley where gardens were laid out on the south-facing slope. It is a series of four terraces across which run diagonal intersecting grass paths.\n\nSee also\nCarron Water, Aberdeenshire Media related to Bervie Water at Wikimedia Commons\nPassage 7:\nCowie Castle\nCowie Castle is a ruined fortress in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.  The site lies at the northern end of Stonehaven on the North Sea coast.  To the immediate south is the Cowie Bridge crossing of the Cowie Water.  Evidence of prehistoric man exists in the vicinity dating to the Iron Age in the form of ring cairns.\n\nStrategic location\nThe ancient Causey Mounth trackway was developed at least as early as the eleventh century AD to connect the coastal portion of Stonehaven to a crossing of the River Dee at the southern edge of Aberdeen.  This strategic route in the Middle Ages fit with the coastal defences of the fortresses of Dunnottar Castle and Cowie Castle, controlling land and sea movements of military units.  Cowie Castle at the north of Stonehaven effectively controlled all coastal land and sea movements to the north.  Proceeding north from Cowie Castle, the Causey Mounth crosses the Burn of Muchalls at the Bridge of Muchalls and thence proceeds northward past Muchalls Castle.  The trackway passes the ruins of the Episcopal Chapels, dating to 1624 situated on the lands of the Muchalls Castle Estate, and thence northerly crossing through the boggy Portlethen Moss (which had a much larger historic extent than present). Cowie Castle is also situated near the southern end of the Elsick Mounth, another strategic route used by the Romans in their northern invasion and also instrumental in subsequent eras' military movements.\nOther nearby castles are the ruined Dunnottar Castle to the south, Fetteresso Castle to the south-west and Muchalls Castle to the north.  St. Nathalan is said to have founded the ruined Chapel of St. Mary and St. Nathalan immediately north of the Cowie Castle site.\n\nThe castle\nCowie is thought to have been the site of a royal hunting lodge in the Middle Ages, and may have served as a royal lodging during progresses through the north-east of Scotland. Only a small section of masonry survives today on the site, which is a scheduled monument.\n\nSee also\nBarony of Cowie\nCowie Village\nFiddes Castle\nPassage 8:\nCowie Water\nThe Cowie Water (Scottish Gaelic: Uisge Chollaidh) is a river of Scotland.\n\nGeography\nThe river rises in the Grampian Mountains in Kincardineshire, and discharges to the North Sea in the northern part of Stonehaven, south of the ruined Cowie Castle. Tributaries of the Cowie Water include the Burn of Monboys, which drains the area to the north, in which the archaeological site Raedykes Roman Camp is situated; and Cowton Burn.\nNotable features in this vicinity include Dunnottar Castle, Fetteresso Castle and Muchalls Castle.  Other nearby coastal waterways discharging to the North Sea include Burn of Muchalls to the north and Carron Water to the south.\n\nHydrology and water quality\nSummer flow rates are typically in the range of 200 cubic feet per second (5.7 m3/s) at the river's mouth.  July values for pH have been measured at 8.2 or slightly alkaline  July water temperatures are about 11.9 degrees Celsius and electrical conductivity at Cowie Bridge near the mouth has been measured at a relatively low value of .07 micro-Siemens per meter.

There are transmitters in Laurencekirk, Inverbervie, Stonehaven and Portlethen leading to a coverage area stretching from St Cyrus to Aberdeen.  The studio is located in Stonehaven.\n\nHistory\nIn 1993, Community Radio in the Mearns area began following a visit to North East Community Radio by members of the Stonehaven Community Centre Management Committee. Stonehaven Community Radio was subsequently formed, and it transmitted for the first time during July 1994 from the old primary school toilet block in Stonehaven Community Centre.  At that time, community stations could only operate for 28 days at a time. The group disbanded in 1998.In 2004, five year community radio licences were introduced, which led to the formation of a new group of enthusiasts. A draft constitution was adopted at the first AGM which was held in the late Summer of 2005. The project was delayed because a round of broadcasting applications had just closed and Ofcom, the regulating authority, did not invite new applications until the late autumn of 2006. It was necessary for the organisation to become a Company Limited by Guarantee and a registered charity.The committee originally planned the station to be named Stonehaven Community Radio but it was decided to become Mearns wide and be called Mearns FM.  Because of the large geographical area of the Mearns, the station applied for three transmitters which Ofcom subsequently agreed to and a licence was issued in early July 2007.The station began broadcasting on 6 June 2009 during the annual Feein' Market in Stonehaven. At 11am the station was officially opened by the local MP, Sir Robert Smith.Since then OFCOM have renewed our license to broadcast twice and we are able to keep broadcasting until at least 2024.\nIn 2016, the station was the only Community Radio Station in Scotland to receive accreditation from the BBC for Eurovision Song Contest coverage.In April 2020 Mearns FM was successful in a bid to increase power at all 3 transmitters and install a new transmitter at Portlethen church hall. This will improve coverage across South Aberdeenshire, half the funding needed to replace 4 transmitters was granted from Aberdeenshire Council and we are very grateful for that help. We will also open a new studio in Portlethen church hall part-financed by the National Lottery awards for all program. Mearns FM also launched on DAB digital radio across North-East Scotland in July 2020.\n\nStudio\nThe station was broadcast from Stonehaven Town Hall from its inception in 2007 until late 2019, when it had to move due to electrical upgrades taking place in the town hall. After broadcasting from temporary studios, the station moved permanently to a new studio on Ann Street on 13 September 2020.\n\nProgramming\nPrograms did include the self-proclaimed \"world's only Doric show\". Every Sunday at 9am, the previous Sunday's worship service of Bervie Church is broadcast.\nPassage 10:\nFetteresso Castle\nFetteresso Castle is a 14th-century tower house, rebuilt in 1761 as a Scottish Gothic style Palladian manor, with clear evidence of prehistoric use of the site. It is situated immediately west of the town of Stonehaven in Kincardineshire, slightly to the west of the A90 dual carriageway. Other notable historic fortified houses or castles in this region are Dunnottar Castle, Muchalls Castle, Fiddes Castle, Cowie Castle and Monboddo House.\n\nPrehistory\nFrom cropmarks in the \"policies\" (improved areas) around Fetteresso Castle, there is evidence of a ring ditch sited at the north end of a cursus. A cursus is a prehistoric set of parallel linear structures of unknown purpose that were, somewhat fancifully, considered by antiquarians as used for some type of athletic competition, possibly related to hunting or archery; this is unsubstantiated. In 1822 a cairn was discovered near Fetteresso Castle with some human remains inside. The size and shape of the chamber made of unhewn whinstone clearly show that the burial site was a Bronze Age construct. Some legends say that this is the grave of Malcolm I, who is recorded to have been slain at Fetteresso in AD 954. The burial hillock has become known as Malcolm's Mount, even though it is not likely from current archaeological analysis that the crypt could be so recent. In 1998 a burial urn from the Beaker people was found at Fetteresso Castle. The Roman Camp of Raedykes is located several miles north-west, where a full legion encamped and many archaeological recoveries have been made. This location is one of a string of marching camps that connected Angus to Moray.\n\nMiddle Ages\nThe property is recorded to have been owned by the Strachans.\nRobert de Bruce opposed the Balliol (and later the Comyn) claim to the throne of Scotland, which culminated at the Battle of Barra Hill (1308). Castlehill of Strachan was in fact burned out by Robert de Bruce, and the Barony of Strachan later disinherited from the de Strachan family and granted by Robert de Bruce to Sir Alexander Fraser in c. 1316 (Robertson Index, 1-15). The Strachan family were supporters and kinsmen of John Comyn, Earl of Buchan.\nThe barony of Fetteresso eventually passed to William Keith, the Earl Marischal of Scotland, who inherited the barony through his mother, the daughter of Sir Alexander Fraser in the 14th century to the Clan Keith Earls Marischal, who built the tower house. The Earls Marischal also held the nearby fortress, Dunnottar Castle.\n\n17th and 18th centuries\nThe characteristic Scottish designs of crow-stepped gables and the battlement crenellation elements were introduced. A dovecote of considerable height was constructed in the 17th century to the south of the castle. In 1659 Jean Hunter lived at Fetteresso. She was accused of witchcraft and hanged at her home. An artist and wright named Alexander Charles worked at Fetteresso as an overseer. Charles flourished from 1671 to 1678 and published his drawings in at least one book. Late in the 17th century, the Duff family controlled Fetteresso and expanded the building around the old tower house.\n\n20th and 21st centuries\nIn the 1940s, the castle was owned by Maurice Simpson and Geraldine Simpson (n\u00e9e Pringle). She was the heir to the Pringle knitware fortune. Subsequently, the Simpsons acquired and lived in nearby Muchalls Castle. After the Simpsons' tenure at Fetteresso, the roof was off the castle for some period starting around 1954, and the castle was bought by a local landowner and then left to the Don family in his will. In the latter part of the 20th century, the castle was restored, greatly modified, to yield seven houses, which is its present use. Ms Simpson continued to reside in the local area until her death in 2010.\n\nSee also\nAllardice Castle\nKirkton of Fetteresso\nRed Cloak\nStonehaven Tolbooth\nUry House\n\nBibliography\nC.

It is based on the novel Native Son by American author Richard Wright, who also stars in the film and co-wrote the screenplay with Chenal. Actor Canada Lee, who was originally scheduled to play the film's protagonist Bigger Thomas, had difficulties with his visa while filming Cry, the Beloved Country (1951) in South Africa and had to decline the role; with the whole production in jeopardy due to the mishap, Wright decided to step in and replace Lee.Due to its controversial plot, the film received severe editing in the United States, which removed about 30 minutes. A restored cut premiered on Turner Classic Movies on February 20, 2021, for the film's 60th anniversary.\nNative Son was later remade in two adaptations: one in 1986 and another in 2019.\n\nPlot summary\nA young black man, Bigger Thomas, is hired as a chauffeur for a progressive, affluent white family living in Chicago in the early 1940s. That evening, he drives their teenage daughter Mary into town to meet left-wing sympathizers. Their attempts to befriend Bigger are baffling to him because no white person has ever been kind to him and reflect how oblivious they are to the reactions of the black man.\nMary gets so drunk with her boyfriend, Jan, that she passes out.  Bigger takes Mary home and carries her to bed. Mary makes advances to Bigger so he kisses her. Mrs. Dalton, who is blind, suddenly opens Mary's door.  Bigger panics and covers her mouth with a pillow. Mary cannot breathe, and he accidentally smothers her to death. Mrs. Dalton merely thinks that Mary has passed out from being drunk and leaves the room.  Bigger moves the body and puts her in the basement furnace, trying to cover up what happened.\nA group of reporters, relegated to the furnace room of the house, notice fragments of bone and an earring in the ashes, prompting Bigger to flee in terror. He joins his girlfriend Bessie, a nightclub singer, in an abandoned building, but when she goes to a drug store for liquor and a sweater for him, Bigger thinks she has conspired with stool pigeon Snippy to put the police onto him, and he murders her, throwing her body into an elevator shaft. He flees the building, but the police give chase, turning a hose on him and forcing his surrender.\nHe is defended by a leftist lawyer with support from Jan, who worked with Mary toward racial equality. Max, the lawyer, fails to overcome the racism of the judge and jury and Bigger is sentenced to death. When Max tearfully says goodbye to Bigger for the last time, Bigger asks him to \"say hello to Mr... to Jan\". Bigger had found two white people capable of kindness to him; all the others put him to death.\n\nCast\nRichard Wright ... Bigger Thomas\nWilla Pearl Curtis ... Mrs. Hannah Thomas\nGloria Madison ...

Richard Wright was a particular fan of film noir, and director Chenal was a pioneer in the style. He was the first to make a film treatment of the novel The Postman Always Rings Twice, and there are many parallels between Native Son and that film noir classic. Regarding the movie's status as a film noir, writers have noted its similarities to this style, stating it has \"noir touches\" and \"the unmistakable feel of noir\", and that it \"does justice to the noir style.\" Other writers have gone further, stating it is \"good noir\" or \"darkly satiric noir\", and \"genuine noir.\" One writer expounded \"indeed it is [film noir] ... Not only in terms of the visual style but in terms of moral ambiguity.\"\n\nProduction\nCasting\nWhile Bigger is 20 years old in the novel, he is about 25 in this version.Americans were the primary actors while Latin Americans and Argentines of African descent had smaller roles.\n\nDevelopment\nThe history of this movie started with the Broadway version of Richard Wright's novel Native Son, produced by Orson Welles. Welles worked with playwright Paul Green and Richard Wright himself on the adaptation. MGM offered Wright $25,000 for the film rights to the novel, but they insisted the movie be cast with white actors exclusively. The independent producer Harold Hecht proposed to make the film, but wanted Bigger to be a white man of an oppressed ethnic background rather than a black man. Wright declined both.\nWright ultimately agreed to a proposal by French director Pierre Chenal to film his version. Chenal's film was greatly influenced by Welles' version and took it as its starting point.France and Italy were approached for location, but both countries refused to grant the requisite permits; they were recipients of US economic aid from the Marshall Plan and were afraid of repercussions if they hosted such an incendiary film. Wright and Chanal then turned to Argentina, where Chanal had already shot several pictures after fleeing from the Nazis in France.  Funding for the film came from Argentina's government, which had raised the money by taxing the box office receipts of Hollywood movies shown there.\nShechtman wrote that the process of making Buenos Aires look like Chicago occurred \"without too much difficulty\". The slums there substituted easily for the slums of Chicago, and Wright was meticulous about recreating Chicago visually, insisting that storefronts and brand names recreated on set were authentic.\nWright played Bigger because his first choice, Canada Lee, who had portrayed the character in the Broadway play, was not able to do so. Many other actors would not consider the role because they were fearful of repercussions; Wright was blacklisted in Hollywood at the time for membership in the communist party. The role of Mary required the white actress to touch a black man, so multiple actresses were unwilling to take the role. Hollywood actress Jean Wallace accepted the female lead, possibly because her career had stalled due to personal problems.\nAmerican studios refused to release the film, but independent distributor Classic Pictures picked it up after extensive editing. About 30 minutes of film had been excised as per the direction of the New York Board of Censors.\n\nRelease and later restoration\nDespite a heavy editing, multiple U.S. states made it illegal to show the new cut of the film.The Library of Congress undertook a restoration, with consultation by Edgardo Krebs of the Smithsonian Institution. In 2012, an in-progress  version of the restoration aired at the New York Film Festival. The fully restored uncut film, stitched together from a complete 16MM Argentine print and an incomplete 35MM print in the Archivo General de Puerto Rico intended for non-United States markets, premiered in the United States at the Museum of Modern Art in 2016.\n\nReception\nShechtman wrote that, in regards to the initial U.S. distribution, \"Reviewers and theatre owners were encouraged to receive it as tawdry entertainment, and most did.\" Chenal stated \"We presented a perfectly massacred version of the film and they have the right to review it.\" A review in an African American newspaper described the edited film as being similar to The Birth of a Nation; the review stated that the film was \"leaving the audience with no choice but to condemn\" Bigger due to omission of key characteristics.The 1951 review in The New York Times described the film as \"a sincere but strangely unconvincing film\". The reviewer added \"The stature of Native Son has been reduced with this exposure of film\". That same review described many of the actors as also being \"amateurish\".Media studies professor Thy Phu stated that the film was \"a commercial and critical disaster\".:\u200a36\u200a Film historian Aljean Harmetz wrote in The New York Times that the 1951 film was \"criticized as amateurish and melodramatic\".Film journalist Anna Shechtman wrote in The New Yorker that the \"amateurism\" in the portrayal of Bigger by Wright \"almost works\" due to the \"slow and stilted\" voice \"as though he's speaking to people in a language they don't know\u2014which, partly, he was.\" Film critic J. Hoberman in The New York Times argued  that the attempt to age Bigger in the film does not help the portrayal and that \"Although Wright's delivery is forceful and his looks camera-friendly, he can't avoid seeming inauthentic in a T-shirt and baseball cap, playing a man half his age.\"Regarding the restored version, Chris Vogner of the Houston Chronicle stated \"Even if it's not a great film, the \"Native Son\" is of historical and cultural significance\".\n\nSee also\nStein, Sadie (2013-07-15). \"Watch Richard Wright Act in Native Son\".

It is an adaptation of the 1866 novel of the same name by Fyodor Dostoevsky. The same year a separate American film adaptation was made featuring Peter Lorre.\nThe film's sets were designed by the art director Aim\u00e9 Bazin. Chenal rejected Bazin's original designs as too realistic and historically faithful, as he wished to create a more expressionist ambience for the film.\n\nCritical reception\nWriting for The Spectator in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a moderately good review, praising the direction and the camerawork particularly during the murder scene, the fidelity of the film to the text upon which it was based, and the acting of Pierre Blanchar in portraying Raskolnikov. Of Harry Bauer's portrayal of Porphyrius, Greene described the acting as \"a lovely performance, the finest I have seen in the cinema this year\". For Greene, the major problem with the film was that by converting it into a film in the third party instead of approaching the tale from within Raskolnikov's mind, the film was necessarily curtailed.\n\nCast\nHarry Baur as Porphyre\nPierre Blanchar as Rodion Raskolnikov\nMadeleine Ozeray as Sonia\nLucienne Le Marchand as Dounia\nMarcelle G\u00e9niat as Mme Raskolnikov\nAlexandre Rignault as Razoumikhine\nSylvie as Catherine Ivanova\nAim\u00e9 Clariond as Loujine\nMagdeleine B\u00e9rubet as Aliona\nGeorges Douking as Nicolas\nMarcel Dela\u00eetre as Marmeladov\nCatherine Hessling as Elisabeth\nDaniel Gilbert as Zamiatov\nPaulette \u00c9lambert as Polia\nPaul Asselin as Lieutenant Poudre\nEug\u00e8ne Chevalier as Le Borgne\nGeno Ferny as Commissioner's assistant\nClaire G\u00e9rard as Nastassia\nL\u00e9on Larive as Koch\nCharles Lemontier as Pestriakov\nPassage 5:\nThe Lafarge Case\nThe Lafarge Case (French: L'Affaire Lafarge) is a 1938 French historical crime film directed by Pierre Chenal and starring Pierre Renoir, Marcelle Chantal and Raymond Rouleau.

He graduated from the University of Glamorgan (now the University of South Wales) with an MA in screenwriting.\n\nCareer\nAfter directing a small-budget film called Footsteps, Evans was hired as a freelance director for a documentary about the Indonesian martial art pencak silat. He became fascinated with it, and discovered Indonesian martial artist Iko Uwais, who was working as a deliveryman for a phone company. Evans cast Uwais in his 2009 film Merantau. He planned to produce a larger action film, but scaled the production budget down and created an action film called The Raid (2011). After the success of The Raid, the larger action film eventually became the basis for its sequel, The Raid 2: Berandal (2014).In late 2016, Evans started working on his next film, Apostle, which stars Dan Stevens. The film was released by Netflix on 12 October 2018.\nIn October 2017, TheWrap reported that Evans had pitched his idea for a Deathstroke solo film and is in early talks to write and direct. Evans also passed on directing a Justice League Dark film. However, in April 2020, Evans said that the film had been delayed and that he was no longer actively involved with the project.\n\nPersonal life\nEvans lived in Jakarta with his wife, Maya, and their daughter, until the family moved back to Wales in 2015.\n\nFilmography\nFilm\nShort film\nTelevision\nAwards\nIn November 2011, The Raid won the Midnight Madness Award at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2011.\nPassage 7:\nTodo un hombre (1943 film)\nTodo un hombre (What a Man) is a 1943 Argentine romantic drama film directed by Pierre Chenal on his Latin film debut, and starring Francisco Petrone\nand Amelia Bence.

It is part of the European route E105. It is 720 kilometers long.\nInaugurated in 1950, the highway starts at the junction of the Moscow Ring Road and Varshavskoye Shosse and travels south-west, immediately bypassing the cities of Tula, Oryol, Kursk and Belgorod before terminating at the border with Ukraine. \nWest of the border at Hoptivka, the road continues through Kharkiv and Zaporizhia to Simferopol and Yalta as the Ukrainian M20 and M18. Prior to the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russian Federation, it was used by Russian summer vacationers who travel to the Black Sea resorts of Crimea; that journey may now be made  by the M4 and A290 instead.\n\nHistory\nAt the heart of the route of the road lies the ancient Crimean tract. The highway Moscow - Kharkiv section was built in 1840\u201360. The road was completely renovated in 1946\u201350, Getting asphalt cover. The route Moscow - Kharkiv - Simferopol in the Soviet period had the number 4.\nBy the time of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, it was decided to build a high-speed road understudy. Olympic Torch Relay took place partly on the new road, despite the fact that only a part of the route in the Moscow region and the junction with the Ring Road was completed in 1980. This was the first interchange in the Soviet Union, the traffic movement on which was carried out in three levels.\n\nSee also\nBerlinka, the never-completed Reichsautobahn Berlin-K\u00f6nigsberg of the Third Reich into East Prussia.\nPassage 4:\nA180 highway (Russia)\nRussian Route A180, also known as Narva Highway (Russian: \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0301\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0301\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0301\u0433\u0430 \u0410180 \u00ab\u041d\u0430\u0301\u0440\u0432\u0430\u00bb, Federal highway A180 \"Narva\") is a Russian federal highway that runs from Saint Petersburg through Ivangorod up to the border with Estonia by the Narva River, with the Estonian city of Narva on the opposite bank, which explains the name of the highway. It is part of European route E20, making its easternmost stretch.\nUp until late 2010, it was designated as \u041c11, which is now the number of the newly planned Moscow\u2013Saint Petersburg motorway.Since the 2000s the road has been being gradually reconstructed to have four lanes instead of two and to pass around the congested streets of Kransnoye Selo.\nThe eastern stretch of the highway adjacent to Saint Petersburg, known there as Tallinskoye Highway (Russian: \u0422\u0430\u043b\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0428\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0435), is a part of World Heritage Site Historic Centre of Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments due to its historical significance and multitude of cultural and historical monuments along its course.\nPassage 5:\nM9 highway (Russia)\nThe Russian route M9, also known as the Baltic Highway, is a 610 km-long trunk road that leads from Moscow through Volokolamsk to Russia's border with Latvia. The road runs north of Moscow across the towns of Krasnogorsk, Istra, Volokolamsk, Zubtsov, Rzhev, Velikiye Luki, and Sebezh, ending up at the state border. It passes Moscow, Tver, and Pskov Oblasts. The highway forms a part of the European route E22 which continues across the border to R\u0113zekne and Riga.In Moscow, the highway follows Zvenigorodskoe Shosse, Mnevniki Street, and Marshala Zhukova Avenue before crossing with Moscow Ring Road. The stretch between Moscow and Volokolamsk is known as Novorizhskoye Shosse. This is the only stretch (along with the part within the city of Moscow) built as a dual carriageway.\nPassage 6:\nEuropean route E411\nEuropean route E411 is a European route in Belgium and France connecting Brussels to Metz via Namur and Arlon. The E411 starts in the municipality of Auderghem alongside the Beaulieu metro station, crosses the municipality on a viaduct, then crosses the Brussels Ring and leaves Auderghem to enter Flanders in Overijse. When it leaves Overijse, the route enters Wallonia in Rixensart. It has an interchange with European route E42 near Namur and with European route E25 near Neufch\u00e2teau. At this point and up to Arlon, the two routes use the same road. In Arlon, route E411 continues to Aubange in Belgium, Longwy in France and on to Metz where it connects to the A31-E25 near Uckange.\nIn Belgium, the route E411 has the national designation A4 and name l'Autoroute des Ardennes and is roughly parallel to the N4 road.\n\nExternal links\nUN Economic Commission for Europe: Overall Map of E-road Network (2007)\nPassage 7:\nHemus motorway\nThe Hemus motorway (Bulgarian: \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u201e\u0425\u0435\u043c\u0443\u0441\u201c, Avtomagistrala \"Hemus\") or Haemus motorway, designated A2, is a partially built motorway in Bulgaria. Its planned length is 418 km, of which 191 km are in operation as of October 2022. The motorway in operation is divided into two sections \u2014 the first one links the capital Sofia with Boaza near Yablanitsa, crossing Stara planina (Balkan mountains), and the second segment connects Varna and Buhovtsi near Targovishte. According to the plans, Hemus motorway would connect Sofia with the third-largest city of Varna, at the Black Sea coast, duplicating European route E70 (Varna\u2013Shumen), European route E772 (Shumen\u2013Yablanitsa) and European route E83 (Yablanitsa\u2013Sofia).\n\nHistory\nOctober 4, 1974\nThe construction of the motorway officially began.

In January 2015, a tender for design and build of 2 lots, between Yablanitsa and the Pleven/Lovech road, has been announced by NCSIP. In 2016 NCSIP was closed, with all activities being transferred to the Roads Agency. The tender for construction of the Yablanitsa - Pleven/Lovech road was cancelled due to lack of secured financing and later in 2016 a new tender for a shorter 9 km stretch between Yablanitsa and Boaza has been announced.\n\nExits\nMiscellaneous\nBebresh Viaduct, regarded as the highest motorway bridge in the Balkans with a clearance of 120 m, is part of the Hemus motorway.\nThe motorway is named after the Haemus Mons, an ancient name of the Balkan Mountains (Stara Planina).\n\nGallery\nPassage 8:\nM1 highway (Russia)\nThe Russian route M1 (also known as the Belarus Highway, road to Minsk) is a major trunk road that runs from Moscow through Smolensk before reaching the border with Belarus.

Based on the eponymous classic story by Na Do-hyang, the film became known for its erotic subject matter, made possible by the government's gradual relaxation of censorship and control over the film industry during the 1980s. It was part of the wave of \"Folk erotic\" films that had become popular in South Korea at this time.\n\nPlot\nAn-hyeop, a beautiful young woman, lives in a small village in Korea during the Japanese occupation. Her husband, Sam-bo, is a traveling gambler who returns home for short periods after months away. During his long absences, An-hyeop earns food, money and other goods by picking mulberry leaves (ppong in Korean) for a neighbor who raises silk-worms, and also by having sex with nearly every male in the village. Angered by An-hyeop's influence over their husbands, the village women conspire to drive her away, first by beating her, and then by convincing the village elder expel her. When the elder visits An-hyeop's home to convince her to leave, she instead wins him over to her side by seducing him. The only man An-hyeop refuses to have sex with is Sam-dol, the village servant. Frustrated and infuriated, Sam-dol retaliates by telling An-hyeop's husband about her sexual promiscuity when he returns to the village. Sam-bo, An-hyeop's husband, reacts by beating Sam-dol for his verbal abuse of his wife. As Sam-bo again leaves to gamble, An-hyeop is again left to fend for herself, gathering mulberry leaves. The film closes with a lively, humorous ode to Spring (\ubd04 - bom) and mulberry (\ubf55 - ppong).\n\nCast\nLee Mi-sook as An-hyeop\nLee Dae-geun as Sam-dol\nLee Moo-jeong as Kim Sam-bo\n\nBackground\nEssentially a melodramic sex-farce, Lee Young-il, in his History of Korean Cinema (1988) points out that the film \"depicts the agony of life under Japanese rule through sexual jests.\" Min, et al. write that the film symbolically shows that, with the husband gone to work with the Independence Movement, there was not much else going on in small villages during the Japanese Occupation but sex.Mulberry was shot on location at Bossam Village, a small, traditional site in Samdong, Ulsan, which was also used in director Im Kwon-taek's Surrogate Womb (\uc528\ubc1b\uc774 - Ssibaji) (1986), a film which helped to bring international attention to the South Korean cinema. The Korean cinematic \"tough guy\" of the era, Lee Dae-geun played the role of the servant, Sam-dol, who is the one man in the village with whom An-hyeop will not have sex. Lee became a sex symbol through his role in the film, which caused the actor some consternation. He states that he had appeared in the film for its literary qualities. Because the erotic elements of the film upstaged the literary aspects in the public eye, he refused to appear in the first sequel, Mulberry 2 (\ubf55 2 - Ppong 2, 1988).\n\nAvailability\nMulberry was released on Region 3 DVD in South Korea in 2005 with English subtitles.

Some objected to the shade of the lead actress' skin, saying that she looked too dark for a Korean. Whiteness of skin was and is still considered important among many in Korea.\nOthers scoffed that it was unlikely that all of the injustices depicted could have happened to one woman. However, it is a vivid and visually spectacular depiction of the struggles many women went through in that time period.\nThe film also polarized audiences and stirred controversy when it was shown at the East\u2013West Center and the Fifth International Film Festival in Honolulu.\n\nSee also\nList of submissions to the 57th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\nList of South Korean submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film\nPassage 3:\nEunuch (film)\nEunuch (Korean: Naeshi) is a 1986 South Korean drama film directed by Lee Doo-yong.

One of the best-known actresses of 1980s Korean cinema, Lee's most famous films from this era include Bae Chang-ho's Whale Hunting and The Winter That Year Was Warm, Lee Doo-yong's Mulberry and Eunuch, and Kwak Ji-kyoon's Wanderer in Winter. She retired from film after getting married in 1987, though she still appeared on television in dramas such as How's Your Husband? (1993). Then a decade later, Lee made her comeback with an award-winning leading role in E J-yong's feature debut An Affair (1998). She has since remained active in film and television, notably in the May\u2013December romance Solitude (2002), the Dangerous Liaisons adaptation Untold Scandal (2003), the mockumentary Actresses (2009), and the family dramas Smile, Mom (2010)\n\nCareer\nLee Mi-sook debuted in film at the age of twenty in Thoughtless Momo in 1979. By the mid-1980s she had become one of the best-known actresses of her era. Together with Lee Bo-hee and Won Mi-kyung, they dominated the screen and were referred to as the \"Troika of the 1980s.\" Her most famous films from this era include Bae Chang-ho's Whale Hunting and The Winter That Year Was Warm, Lee Doo-yong's Mulberry and Eunuch, and Kwak Ji-kyoon's Wanderer in Winter. Her early career lasted until the film Love Triangle in 1987, and then she retired from the cinema after getting married.Over ten years later, in 1998, Lee returned with a widely praised role in E J-yong's award-winning film An Affair, about a woman who falls in love with her sister's fianc\u00e9. Using this film as a springboard, she re-launched her career.In 2000, Lee was cast in the high-profile project The Legend of Gingko, which was considered to be production company Kang Je-gyu Film's followup to the successful Shiri (even though Kang himself was not directing). However the film proved to be a critical and commercial disappointment. Lee's next two films, Kiss Me Much and Oh! Lala Sisters, were also more or less ignored by audiences. In contrast, her appearances in TV dramas such as Solitude (2002) were more successful.However, 2003 was one of Lee's best years, with her highly praised role in E J-yong's Untold Scandal, a retelling of the novel Dangerous Liaisons set in the Joseon Dynasty, and her role as a single mother in Lee Eon-hee's well-received melodrama ...ing.Lee next starred in Hellcats, a 2008 romantic comedy that traces the lives and loves of three characters at different stages of womanhood. Then in 2009 Lee reunited with E J-yong in Actresses, a semi-improvisational mockumentary featuring six actresses each playing themselves.In 2011, Lee launched her own lingerie line Starit, which was sold on home shopping channels. This would've been virtually unheard of in previous years with the fashion industry's historically narrow focus on young women. But since 2008 the sophisticated and stylish image of actresses such as Lee, Choi Myung-gil and Kim Hee-ae became aspirational for middle-aged women in Korea, and brands specifically targeting women in their 40s and 50s have increased. Lee remains a favorite in editorial spreads in fashion magazines, notably a 2010 Elle Korea feature opposite pop star TOP.Lee continued to act on television, giving a vulgar, selfish, but human spin to her role as the stepmother in Cinderella's Sister, a ratings hit in 2010. 2012's Love Rain, a Yoon Seok-ho melodrama that jumps between the 1970s and the present, inked overseas distribution deals, but was unsuccessful domestically.After a judging stint on reality acting talent program Miracle Audition, Lee hosted the cable talk show Bad Scene, which featured celebrities who reveal bad or embarrassing scenes from their past.In August 2022, she left SidusHQ and signed with new agency Hunus Entertainment.\n\nLawsuit\nIn 2012, Lee was embroiled in a controversy when she was sued by her former agency, The Contents Media, after she moved to a new agency, Hoya Spotainment. The Seoul High Court ruled that Lee was guilty of breach of contract and ordered her to pay \u20a9120 million (US$110,604) in damages. However, The Contents Media filed an appeal, stating that the agency was owed at least double the amount. They alleged that Lee had been involved in a romantic relationship with a man 17 years her junior in 2006, whom they claimed to have paid off in millions of won to keep him from talking to the press and tarnishing Lee's image. Lee counter-sued The Contents Media and the two reporters who broke the story for defamation. Lee lost her appeal in February 2013, and the Seoul High Court ruled for her to pay the amount in the original ruling.In August 2013, she signed with another agency, SidusHQ.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2007, Lee and her husband Hong Sung-ho, a plastic surgeon, divorced after 20 years of marriage. They have a son and a daughter.\n\nFilmography\n*Note; the whole list is referenced.\n\nTelevision series\nVariety show\nBook\nAwards\nPassage 5:\nBruce Lee Fights Back from the Grave\nBruce Lee Fights Back from the Grave, originally released as Visitor of America (Korean: \uc544\uba54\ub9ac\uce74 \ubc29\ubb38\uac1d; Hanja: \uc544\uba54\ub9ac\uce74 \u8a2a\u554f\u5ba2; RR: Amelika bangmungaeg), is a 1976 Bruceploitation supernatural martial arts film starring tae kwon do instructor Jun Chong (credited as \ucf00\ub9ac\u30fb\u90d1 Ke-li Chong in the original South Korean version and as Bruce K. L. Lea in the English-dubbed and altered U.S. edit). The film was directed by Lee Doo-yong, though persistent misinformation claims that the movie was directed by Italian horror director Umberto Lenzi.\n\nPlot overview\nThe opening sequence (which was filmed separately and added to the original South Korean film when the film was dubbed into English) shows Bruce Lee (played by an unknown imitator), leaping from his grave after it is struck by lightning. While this and the title imply a story involving Bruce Lee returning from the afterlife in order to do battle, the rest of the movie revolves around a plot that has nothing to do with Bruce Lee. Instead, it talks about a certain Wong Han, a Korean man trying to discover the truth behind the death of his brother, Han Ji-Hyeok. He travels to Los Angeles and allies himself with a woman named Suzanne. Han is harassed by a number of petty criminals and thugs in his attempt to find out the truth about his brother. Eventually, he begins to suspect that Ji-Hyeok is still alive and involved in a criminal racket.\n\nCast\nJun Chong (credited as \ucf00\ub9ac\u30fb\u90d1 Ke-li Chong / Bruce K. L.

It was later shown in the Special Presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nPlot\nSivadhasan is a Tamil Tiger soldier during the last days of the Sri Lankan Civil War. After the armed conflict resolves, his side loses and he is forced to move to a refugee camp. There he decides to move to France to take a fresh chance at life. However, in order to secure political asylum, he requires a convincing cover story. He is given the passport of a dead man, Dheepan Natarajan, and pairs with people he barely knows posing as his family. Along with his supposed wife, Yalini and his supposed 9-year-old daughter, Illayaal, they get on a ship bound for Paris. Upon arrival, he lands a job as a resident caretaker and starts building a new life in a banlieue housing project named Le Pr\u00e9. He winds up as a caretaker of a rough housing project controlled by drug dealers (filmed on location in the peaceful project of La Coudraie, in the suburban city of Poissy). The new home turns out to be another conflict zone for him. Shootouts between rival drug gangs terrify Yalini and Illayaal as they try to fit into their roles as mother and daughter. Yalini is pressured to accept a job as a nurse-maid to the father of the local drug lord. Sivadhasan attends to his duties in spite of the chaos that surrounds him but is drawn into the fight. Caught in the crossfire of a climactic gunfight, Sivadhasan's latent battle-readiness resurfaces and he single-handedly destroys an entire gang with just a handgun, a machete and a screwdriver. He rescues Yalini from her boss's blood-soaked apartment. Eventually they all manage to immigrate to England where they find real peace.\n\nCast\nAntonythasan Jesuthasan as Dheepan Natarajan/Sivadhasan\nKalieaswari Srinivasan as Yalini\nClaudine Vinasithamby as Illayaal\nVincent Rottiers as Brahim\nMarc Zinga as Youssouf\nFaouzi Bensa\u00efdi as Mr. Habib\nBass Dhem as Azziz\nFranck Falise as Janitor of Hallway C\nJos\u00e9phine de Meaux as Headmistress\nJean-Baptiste Pouilloux as Jurist\nNathan Anthonypillai as Interpreter\nVasanth Selvam as Colonel Cheran\n\nProduction\nDirector Jacques Audiard started making the film with the intent to make a variation of Sam Peckinpah's 1971 thriller Straw Dogs.

Commenting on the film, critic Jason Gorber notes that besides depicting immigrant experiences and integration, the film \"is polemical without being didactic, and its message about human spirit and how connections of love can flourish in the most astonishing of ways is extremely moving\". The Independent called it \"a radical and astonishing film that turns conventional thinking about immigrants on its head\".\n\nAccolades\nThe film won the Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. After winning the award, Audiard said \"To receive a prize from the Coen brothers is something pretty exceptional. I'm very touched\".

Since 2013, Six Flags has installed Aqua Twists in three of their parks.\n\nHistory\nOn August 30, 2012, La Ronde's owner Six Flags announced that they would be adding Aqua Twist to the park in 2013. On June 1, 2013, the attraction officially opened to the public, making La Ronde the first amusement park in North America to install a ride of its kind.On June 28, 2013, Six Flags filed for a trademark with the United States Patents and Trademark Office for the name \"Aqua Twist\", leading to speculation that the company has plans for future installations at its other parks in the United States. On August 29, 2013, Six Flags officially announced the ride would be installed at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom and Six Flags St. Louis for the 2014 season under the name Tsunami Soaker. Tsunami Soaker at Six Flags St. Louis was the first to open in the United States on May 24, 2014, replacing the Powder Keg (also known as Hannibarrels) ride that had sat idle since 1997. A week later, Six Flags Discovery Kingdom open their new Tsunami Soaker on May 31, 2014, which is located at the former location of Wave Jumper located next to the wooden roller coaster, Roar.In 2016, Six Flags renovated Roar at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom and reopened it as The Joker, which led to the re-theme of Tsunami Soaker to The Penguin Ride, themed after the DC Comics villain Penguin to fit the theme of the area of where the ride is located.\n\nInstallations\nRide experience\nRiders board one of the nine boats. Before the ride's operational cycle begins the floor under the boats get filled with water, resulting in the boats floating. Once the ride begins the boats rotate like a traditional teacups attraction from an amusement park. There are six water guns that are equipped onto the boats as a way to splash other riders and bystanders. The ride operates with nine boats that feature six seats each, resulting in 54 riders per cycle.\nPassage 4:\nHog Lake (Florida)\nHog Lake is a natural freshwater lake in the Sun 'N Lakes community, in Highlands County, Florida.  Hog Lake has a surface area of 19.6-acre (79,000 m2).  About 1-acre (4,000 m2) of this is a manmade island inside the lake.  The lake is directly north of the Sun 'N Lakes community center and is inside a park.  The country club restaurant is directly north of the lake.The island inside Hog Lake may be reached by a wooden footbridge.  A 75 foot (23 m) pier is on the north side of the island.  Swimming and boating are not allowed on Hog Lake.  Fishing is allowed on the pier.\nPassage 5:\nG. O. Guy\nG.O. Guy was a small chain of drugstores located in the Seattle area of the U.S. state of Washington. The chain was founded in 1888 by George Omar Guy. Throughout the early 20th century, G.O. Guy's was the second largest drug store chain in Seattle behind Bartell Drugs and predated it by two years. In 1987 Pay 'n Save purchased all six locations and converted most of them to Pay 'n Save express stores, slightly smaller than full service stores. Pay 'n Save was bought by Thrifty PayLess which in turn was bought by Rite Aid.\n\nOriginal location\nMany modern sources give the location of the first store as the H. K. Owens / Metropole Building at Second Avenue and Yesler Way, however contemporary sources indicate that Guy's first store was actually located about two blocks south, at Occidental Avenue and Main Street. For example, Guy's January 31, 1927, obituary in the Seattle Daily Times, reads:\n\nMr. Guy started his drug business at the corner of Occidental Avenue and Main Street. After the great fire a year later [i.e. in 1889], which demolished his store, he resumed business in a tent at First Avenue and Main Street and in 1893 occupied, at Second Avenue and Yesler Way, the present site of the drug company.A Times article from 1934 gives further details of the several years following the fire:\n\nGuy's first thought was for the medicines, and he saved them to establish headquarters in a first-aid tent, where he stayed until a frame building was finished at Fourth Avenue and Main Street... Later he moved to First Avenue and Main Street and, in 1893, he moved to Second Avenue and Yesler Way. There the store still stands.\n\nShootout at Second and Yesler\nThe G.O. Guy drugstore at the corner of Second Avenue and Yesler Way in Seattle was the site of an infamous shootout in 1901.Seattle police chief William L. Meredith had been fired for corruption as part of a feud with \"box house\" owner John Considine. John Considine owned the People's Theater, a \"box house,\" offering light entertainment \"such as magic acts, singing, dancing, minstrel shows,\" but also providing sexual services. Their feud had led to Meredith's resignation under pressure.Meredith, out of a job, came gunning for Considine. After Meredith got off a couple of wild shots, Considine's brother Tom Considine managed to grab a gun and use it as a club to fracture Meredith's skull; John Considine shot Meredith in the heart. The struggle lasted about 90 seconds altogether. The Considines were ultimately acquitted for the killing.\n\nLocations\nLocations included, but not limited to:\n\nSecond Avenue and Yesler Way \n725 3rd Avenue, also described as the corner of 3rd Avenue and Columbia \n1401 3rd Avenue in the Mann Building  also described as the corner of 3rd Avenue and Union, opposite the post office \n406 Broadway East, also described as corner Broadway and Harrison  and as 406 North Broadway \n4501 University Way \n4700 California Avenue SW \n2238 Market Street \n4002 Roosevelt Way \n518 Queen Anne Avenue \n1928 3rd Avenue, also described as corner of 3rd Avenue and Virginia Street in the Security Market Building \n1024 Madison Street \n4002 10th Ave NE at north end of University Bridge \n4727 California Avenue SW \n427 2nd Avenue South \n3600 South Village Mall \n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 6:\nBay Lake, Florida\nBay Lake is a city in Orange County, Florida, United States. The population was 29 at the 2020 census. It is named after a lake that lies east of the Magic Kingdom. All four of the Walt Disney World Resort theme parks, and one of Walt Disney World's two water parks, are in Bay Lake, though all Disney parks in the region have mailing addresses in nearby Lake Buena Vista.\nBay Lake is one of two Florida municipalities inside the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District (formerly the Reedy Creek Improvement District) which also includes Walt Disney World, the other being Lake Buena Vista. The city is part of the Orlando\u2013Kissimmee\u2013Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\nHistory\nChapter 67-1104 of the Laws of Florida, incorporating the city of Bay Lake, was signed into law by Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. on May 12, 1967, the same day he also signed chapters 67-764 (creating the Reedy Creek Improvement District, or RCID), also known as the Reedy Creek Improvement Act, and 67-1965 (incorporating the City of Reedy Creek). It was and still is located fully inside the RCID, and all its duties have been taken care of by the RCID. As fully described in Reedy Creek Improvement District, the city has always been controlled by the Walt Disney Company and has allowed them powers that other area attractions have not had.\nChapter 69-836 of the Laws of Florida, which became a law on July 3, 1969, without the governor's approval, redefined the city boundaries to exclude the easternmost part of Bay Lake. Chapter 69\u20131527, which became a law the same day, completely moved the city of Reedy Creek, with the land given up by Bay Lake included in the new city. Since then, Bay Lake has expanded to fill the original RCID west of Bonnet Creek, but the Reedy Creek Improvement District has expanded to include new land not in the city.\nThe RCID had all the powers of the city and more, raising the question of why cities were incorporated inside of it. Walt Disney's original plans for the site included at least one futuristic living area, a planned \"community of the future\". This was never built, but some of the ideas were incorporated into the EPCOT theme park. The later Celebration, Florida was deannexed from the city and the RCID in 1994 so the Walt Disney Company would not lose control of the district. The only residents of the city are Disney employees and their immediate family members who live in a community on the north shore of Bay Lake (on Bay Court). The only landowners are fully owned subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company, rights-of-way for state and county roads, and five five-acre (2.0 ha) lots owned by senior Disney employees to give them voting power in the Reedy Creek Improvement District.\n\nGeography and climate\nBay Lake is located at 28\u00b023\u203229\u2033N 81\u00b034\u20320\u2033W (28.391502, \u201381.566659).According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 22.8 square miles (59.1 km2), of which 21.5 square miles (55.7 km2) is land and 1.4 square miles (3.5 km2) (5.86%) is water.The principal border that divides the cities of Lake Buena Vista to the east and Bay Lake to the west is the canal called Bonnet Creek, adjacent to Bonnet Creek Parkway. Most of the attractions associated with the Walt Disney World Resort are actually located within the City of Bay Lake, including all four theme parks.\nThe only long-term residents in Bay Lake live in a mobile home park on Bay Court, a street which, in 1987, was a dirt road. As of that year many employees wished to live in Bay Lake or Lake Buena Vista due to their proximity to their jobs.\n\nDemographics\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 23 people, 9 households, and 6 families residing in the city. The population density was 1.2 inhabitants per square mile (0.4/km2). There were 9 housing units at an average density of 0.5 per square mile (0.2/km2). The racial makeup of the city was twenty-two whites (95.7%) and one African American (4.3%). None of the people in Bay Lake were Asian, Native American or Hispanics or Latinos.\nThere were nine households in Bay Lake, out of which three had children under the age of 18 living with them, five had married couples living together, one had a female householder with no husband present, and three of the households were non-families. Three households were made up of individuals, and one consisted of someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.56 and the average family size was 3.00.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $86,288, and the median income for a family was $86,288. Males had a median income of $76,284 versus $21,667 for females. The per capita income for the city was $26,731. None of the population and none of the families were below the poverty line.\nBecause of Bay Lake statistics, legislators have to be careful not to use the words \"maximum\" and \"average\" in the computations used for the State of Florida's 2007 property tax reform debate.  For example, in 2006 the \"per capita levy\" of property tax in Bay Lake was $176,230.  Since the statewide average that year was $475, legislators have had to be careful to distinguish the phrase \"average savings\" from the phrase \"savings by the average taxpayer.\"In 2010 Bay Lake had a population of 47.  The racial and ethnic composition of the population was 72.3% white, 6.4% Asian, 4.3% of two or more races and 17.0% Hispanic or Latino.\n\nPoints of interest\nWalt Disney World:\nMagic Kingdom\nDisney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground\nMagnolia and Palm Golf Courses\nDisney's BoardWalk Resort\nEpcot\nDisney's Animal Kingdom\nDisney's Blizzard Beach\nDisney's Hollywood Studios\nESPN Wide World of Sports Complex\nDisney's Animal Kingdom Lodge\nStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser\n\nGovernment and infrastructure\nThe Reedy Creek Improvement District has its Fire Department Emergency Services station in Bay Lake (it has a Lake Buena Vista postal address).\n\nEducation\nResidents of Bay Lake (Bay Court) are zoned to schools in the Orange County Public Schools:\nBay Lake Elementary SchoolIt opened in 2016, relieving Horizon West area elementary schools and making it one of three schools to open that year in the county. Myrlene Kimble was the school's first principal. The 94,279-square-foot (8,758.8 m2) building, with a capacity of 837 students, is on a 15-acre (6.1 ha) property. In fall 2016 it had 785 students. Its design is similar to that of Independence Elementary School.\nBridgewater Middle School\nWindermere High SchoolFormerly it was zoned to the following:\n\nIndependence Elementary School (prior to 2016)\nWindermere Elementary School\nLakeview Middle School\nWest Orange High School (prior to 2017)\nPassage 7:\nRay's Splash Planet\nRay's Splash Planet (often referred to as Ray's) is a Mecklenburg County, North Carolina funded water park located in Charlotte, North Carolina, United States. The aquatic facility is operated by the Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation department. Ray's Splash Planet is considered one of the largest indoor water parks in both of the Carolinas and is the largest water park in Charlotte, North Carolina, with over 29,000 square feet of space and using over 117,000 gallons of water at 87 degrees. The water is cleaned and sanitized through the use of chlorine, filtration and an ultraviolet germicidal irradiation system. There are multiple attractions including the Blue Comet, a three-story figure 8 slide, and other family friendly attractions like the Orbiter, Saturation Station, the Vortex, Meteor Showers, Moon Beach and the Sea of Tranquility. The water park also features a fitness center and gymnasium shared with the Irwin Academic Center, an educational center of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools system. The first floor of the facility includes the pool area, locker rooms, birthday party classrooms and concessions stand. The second story includes the fitness center with an aerobics/dance studio. Access to the indoor gymnasium is also located on the second floor. Ray's Splash Planet is located on North Sycamore Street near Johnson & Wales University and is just off Interstate 77 in North Carolina in the Third Ward section of Uptown Charlotte.  The water park opened on October 15, 2002 with help from Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation's partnership with Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools. Major competitors are Carowinds in Charlotte, North Carolina, Great Wolf Lodge in Concord, North Carolina and Wet 'n Wild Emerald Pointe in Greensboro, North Carolina.\n\nHistory\nIn 1994, a plan was suggested to turn the Irwin Avenue Elementary School into a new recreation center. Extensive renovation of the gymnasium followed the approval of a 1995 park bond referendum, and the (basketball) gymnasium opened to the public in 1998 as the Irwin Avenue Recreation Center. The referendum also allowed for design for one of the first indoor water parks in the Southeast. Land for the water park was available on the Irwin Elementary campus, adjacent to a natural creek that is park of the Mecklenburg County greenway system and that connects surrounding neighborhoods. The architect firm Clark/Nexsen designed the water park facilities, emphasizing the movement of water and incorporating the nearby natural creek as its design. The $7.5 million project had its groundbreaking in March 2001. Physically attached to the Irwin Academic Center (previously known as Irwin Avenue Elementary) through the shared space of the gymnasium, Ray's Splash Planet opened on October 15, 2002. Since 2002, Ray's Splash Planet has won numerous awards and accolades for being a feature attraction for local residents from the Charlotte Observer newspaper, Creative Loafing and Charlotte Parent magazines.\n\nRides and attractions\nSee also\nList of waterparks\nPassage 8:\nAshland/63rd station\nAshland/63rd is an 'L' station and the terminal of the CTA Green Line's Ashland branch, located in the West Englewood neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. Situating at 6315 S. Ashland Avenue, the station contains a Park 'n' ride lot with 235 spaces as well as a Kiss 'n' Ride lane. This is one of two stations on the Green Line to be named Ashland. The other station is on the Lake Street branch and is shared between the Green and Pink Lines. The Red Line served this station from May 19, 2013 to October 20, 2013, April 3, 2017 to November 22, 2017, and July 30, 2018 to April 26, 2019.\n\nHistory\nLoomis\nLoomis was a station on the Englewood branch of the Chicago \"L\". Although other stations on the Englewood branch opened in stages, the station opened on July 13, 1907, concluding overall construction of the branch. Despite improvements to the station, it was closed in 1969 when the new Ashland/63rd station opened two blocks west.\n\nAshland/63rd\nThe Ashland/63rd station opened on May 6, 1969 to replace the Loomis station. Though the station itself was not rebuilt during the course of the Green Line renovation in 1994-96, an elevator was added to the station to make it accessible to passengers with disabilities.\n\nBus connections\nCTA\n\n 9 Ashland (Owl Service) \n X9 Ashland Express (Weekday Rush Hours only) \n 63 63rd  (Owl Service)\n\nImage gallery\nSee also\nAshland (CTA Green and Pink Lines station)\nAshland (CTA Orange Line station)\nAshland Yard\nPassage 9:\nWet 'n Wild Emerald Pointe\nWet 'n Wild Emerald Pointe (often simply referred to as Wet 'n Wild or Emerald Pointe) is a water park located in Greensboro, North Carolina, United States, and part of the Wet 'n Wild chain. There are 40 rides and attractions, including 5 pools, 2 children's areas, and one of the largest wave pools in the country. The Themed Entertainment Association has ranked the park 20th in North America in terms of attendance, of which they had 407,000 visitors as of 2015. Major regional competitors are Carowinds' Carolina Harbor in Charlotte, North Carolina and Dollywood's Splash Waterpark in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.\n\nHistory\nOriginally named Aqua Gardens, the park opened in September 1983. From 1984 to 1986, it used the name Water Country USA. In 1986, it was purchased by a local company and renamed Emerald Pointe. In March 1999 Ogden Corp purchased the property, along with Raging Waters and Wet 'n Wild's assets, and renamed the park Wet 'n Wild Emerald Pointe. In 2019, the newest attraction \"Bombs Away\" was revealed at the end of the season to the public and was originally slated to open for the 2020 season. Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, it has been delayed to open for the 2022 Season.\n\nRides and attractions\nCurrent attractions\nFormer attractions\nSee also\nWet 'n Wild (brand)\nPassage 10:\nHat 'n' Boots\nHat 'n' Boots is a roadside attraction and landmark in the Georgetown neighborhood of Seattle, Washington.  Built in 1954 as part of a Western-themed gas station, it is billed as the largest hat and cowboy boots in America.  To preserve this landmark, the City of Seattle moved the Hat 'n' Boots to the new Oxbow Park in December 2003.\nHat 'n' Boots appeared in the films National Lampoon's Vacation (during the opening credits) and Hype!", "answers": ["Orange County"], "incorrect_answer": "Osceola County"}, {"input": "Which genus of flowering plant is found in an environment further south, Crocosmia or Cimicifuga?", "context": "Passage 1:\nLycium ruthenicum\nLycium ruthenicum (Chinese: \u9ed1\u679c\u67b8\u675e; pinyin: hei guo gou qi), is a flowering plant commonly known as Russian box thorn in the West. is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family which can be found in Central Asia, southern part of Russia, throughout Northwest China, Northern India and Pakistan.

In Central Asia and Northwest China the species grows on elevation of 400\u20133,000 metres (1,300\u20139,800 ft) in saline deserts, sands and roadsides.\nPassage 2:\nCrocosmia aurea\nCrocosmia aurea, common names falling stars, Valentine flower, or montbretia, is a perennial  flowering plant belonging to the family Iridaceae.\n\nEtymology\nThe genus name is derived from the Greek words krokos, meaning \"saffron\", and osme, \nmeaning \"odor\", as dried leaves of these plants, when immersed in hot water, emit a strong smell similar to saffron. The species Latin name aurea, meaning \u201cgolden\u201d, refers to the bright colour of the flowers.\n\nDescription\nCrocosmia aurea reaches on average 120 centimetres (47 in) in height. It grows from basal underground corms with long stolons. The basal, alternate leaves are cauline, linear, with a distinct midvein and entire margins, about 20\u201330 millimetres (0.79\u20131.18 in) wide. At the end of the flower stalk they have colourful branched inflorescences of bright orange to red flowers, reaching on average 40 millimetres (1.6 in) in diameter. The flowering period extends from June through August. The fruit is a capsule, with small blackish and round seeds. The plant can also be propagated by dividing the clumps of corms, fleshy underground stems similar to bulbs.\n\nDistribution\nCrocosmia aurea is widely distributed in southern and eastern Africa, from South Africa to Sudan. In South Africa it is common in the grasslands of the Cape Floristic Region.\n\nHabitat\nUsually these plants live in large colonies in shady forests and in banks of the rivers. They prefer moist habitats, at an altitude of 0\u20132,000 metres (0\u20136,562 ft) above sea level..\n\nGallery\nPassage 3:\nCrocosmia\nCrocosmia (;), also known as montbretia (), is a small genus of flowering plants in the iris family, Iridaceae. It is native to the grasslands of southern and eastern Africa, ranging from South Africa to Sudan. One species is endemic to Madagascar.\n\nDescription\nThey can be evergreen or deciduous perennials that grow from basal underground corms. The alternate leaves are cauline and ensiform (sword shaped). The blades are parallel-veined. The margin is entire. The corms form in vertical chains with the youngest at the top and oldest and largest buried most deeply in the soil. The roots of the lowermost corm in a chain are contractile roots and drag the corm deeper into the ground where conditions allow. The chains of corms are fragile and easily separated, a quality that has enabled some species to become invasive and difficult to control in the garden.\nThey have colourful inflorescences of 4 to 20 vivid red and orange subopposite flowers on a divaricately (horizontally) branched stem. The terminal inflorescence can have the form of a cyme or a raceme. These flower from early summer well into fall. The flowers are sessile on a flexuose arched spike. The fertile flowers are hermaphroditic. All stamens have an equal length. The style branches are apically forked. They are pollinated by insects, birds (sunbirds) or by the wind. The dehiscent capsules are shorter than they are wide.\nThe genus name is derived from the Greek words krokos, meaning \"saffron\", and osme, meaning \"odor\" \u2013 from the dried leaves emitting a strong smell like that of saffron (a spice derived from Crocus \u2013 another genus belonging to the Iridaceae) \u2013 when immersed in hot water.The alternative name montbretia is still widely used, especially for the garden hybrid C. \u00d7 crocosmiiflora.  \"Montbretia\" commonly used in the British Isles for orange-flowered C. \u00d7 crocosmiiflora cultivars that have naturalised, while \"crocosmia\" is reserved for less aggressive red-flowered cultivars.  Montebretia is a heterotypic synonym of the genus Tritonia in which some species of Crocosmia were once included.  It was named by Alire Raffeneau Delile for Ernest Coquebert de Montbret, a fellow French botanist on Napoleon's Egyptian Campaign.\n\nSpecies\nSpecies accepted by World Checklist of Selected Plant Families\nCrocosmia ambongensis (H.Perrier) Goldblatt & J.

It has 27 pairs of chromosomes. A perennial flowering plant, it has leaves between 3\u20135 cm in length and flower heads that are 3\u20134.5 cm with white petals. Typically, flowering occurs in October to December annually. It the floral emblem of Hy\u014dgo Prefecture.\n\nDistribution\nCurrently it is classified as semi-endangered. Native only in Japan. It is naturally found in Shikoku (coastal area of Kochi prefecture and Ehime prefecture).\n\nIndustrial uses\nIt is used in the manufacture of nojigiku alcohol.\nPassage 5:\nWolffia arrhiza\nWolffia arrhiza is a species of flowering plant known by the common names spotless watermeal and rootless duckweed, belonging to the Araceae, a family rich in water-loving species, such as Arum and Pistia. It is the smallest vascular plant on Earth. It is native to Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia, and it is present in other parts of the world as a naturalized species.\n\nDescription\nWolffia arrhiza is an aquatic plant which grows in quiet water bodies such as ponds. The green part of the plant, the frond, is a sphere measuring about 1 mm wide, but with a flat top that floats at the water's surface. It has a few parallel rows of stomata. There is no root. The plant produces a minute flower fully equipped with one stamen and one pistil. It often multiplies by vegetative reproduction, however, with the rounded part budding off into a new individual. In cooler conditions the plant becomes dormant and sinks to the bed of the water body to overwinter as a turion. The plant is a mixotroph which can produce its own energy by photosynthesis or absorb it from the environment in the form of dissolved carbon.\n\nHuman uses\nThis tiny plant is a nutritious food. Its green part is about 40% protein by dry weight and its turion is about 40% starch. It contains many amino acids important to the human diet, relatively large amounts of dietary minerals and trace elements such as calcium, magnesium, and zinc, and vitamin B12. It has long been used as a cheap food source in Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand, where it is known as khai-nam (\"eggs of the water\").  The plant is prolific in its reproduction, growing in floating mats that can be harvested every 3 to 4 days; it has been shown to double its population in less than four days in vitro.It is also useful as a form of agricultural and municipal water treatment. It is placed in effluent from black tiger shrimp farms to absorb and metabolize pollutants. The plants grow quickly and take up large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus from the water. The plants that grow in the wastewater can then be used as feed for animals, such as carp, Nile tilapia, and chickens.\nPassage 6:\nActaea racemosa\nActaea racemosa, the black cohosh, black bugbane, black snakeroot, rattle-top, or fairy candle (syn. Cimicifuga racemosa), is a species of flowering plant of the family Ranunculaceae. It is native to eastern North America from the extreme south of Ontario to central Georgia, and west to Missouri and Arkansas. It grows in a variety of woodland habitats, and is often found in small woodland openings. The roots and rhizomes were used in traditional medicine by Native Americans. Its extracts are manufactured as herbal medicines or dietary supplements. Most dietary supplements containing black cohosh are not well-studied or recommended for safe and effective use in treating menopause symptoms or any disease. In contrast, some herbal medicinal products containing black cohosh extract hold a marketing authorization in several states of the European Union and are well-studied and recommended for safe and effective use for the relief of menopausal symptoms (i.e. in the years around menopause) such as hot flushes and profuse sweating attacks. Such differentiation between the product types seems to be important.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe plant species has a history of taxonomic uncertainty. Carl Linnaeus, on the basis of morphological characteristics of the inflorescence and seeds, placed the species into the genus Actaea. This designation was later revised by Thomas Nuttall reclassifying the species to the genus Cimicifuga. Nuttall's classification was based solely on the dry follicles produced by black cohosh, which are typical of species in Cimicifuga. However, recent data from morphological and gene phylogeny analyses demonstrate that black cohosh is more closely related to species of the genus Actaea than to other Cimicifuga species. This has prompted the revision to Actaea racemosa as originally proposed by Linnaeus. Blue cohosh (Caulophyllum thalictroides), despite its similar common name belongs to another family, the Berberidaceae, is not closely related to black cohosh, and may be unsafe if used together.\n\nDescription\nBlack cohosh is a smooth (glabrous) herbaceous perennial plant that produces large, compound leaves from an underground rhizome, reaching a height of 25\u201360 cm (9.8\u201323.6 in). The basal leaves are up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) long and broad, forming repeated sets of three leaflets (tripinnately compound) having a coarsely toothed (serrated) margin.\nThe flowers are produced in late spring and early summer on a tall stem, 75\u2013250 cm (30\u201398 in) tall, forming racemes up to 50 cm (20 in) long. The flowers have no petals or sepals, and consist of tight clusters of 55\u2013110 white, 5\u201310 mm (0.20\u20130.39 in) long stamens surrounding a white stigma. The flowers have a distinctly sweet, fetid smell that attracts flies, gnats, and beetles.The fruit is a dry follicle 5\u201310 mm (0.20\u20130.39 in) long, with one carpel, containing several seeds.\n\nCultivation\nA. racemosa grows in dependably moist, fairly heavy soil. It bears tall tapering racemes of white midsummer flowers on wiry black-purple stems, whose mildly unpleasant, medicinal smell at close range gives it the common name \"Bugbane\". The drying seed heads stay handsome in the garden for many weeks. Its deeply cut, superficially maple-like leaves, burgundy colored in the variety \"atropurpurea\", add interest to gardens, wherever summer heat and drought do not make it die back, which make it a popular garden perennial. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.The plant was Virginia Native Plant Society\u2019s 2017 wildflower of the year.\n\nTraditional medicine\nHistory\nNative Americans used black cohosh in the belief it could treat gynecological and other disorders. Following the arrival of European settlers in the U.S. who continued the use of black cohosh, the plant appeared in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia under the name \"black snakeroot\". In the 19th century, the root was used to treat snakebite, inflamed lungs, and pain from childbirth.\n\nHerbalism\nExtracts from the underground parts of the plant \u2014 the rhizome (Cimicifugae racemosae rhizoma) and the root (Cimicifugae racemosae radix) \u2014 are used in herbal medicine. The rhizomes and roots contain various saponins (triterpene saponins and triterpene glycosides, such as actein) as well as cimifugic acids and other phenol carboxylic acids.In most European countries, China, Malaysia, Thailand, Argentina and some other countries, black cohosh products are available as herbal products which have been approved by regulatory authorities ensuring reliable pharmaceutical quality, safety and efficacy for the relief of menopausal complaints such as hot flushes and profuse sweating. In the U.S., India, and some other countries, black cohosh is used as a dietary supplement marketed mainly to women for treating menopausal symptoms and other gynecological problems. Meta-analyses of contemporary evidence support these claims on menopausal complaints only for products holding a marketing authorization for this indication, whereas there is no high-quality scientific evidence to support such uses for other products.\n\nSafety concerns\nThe Herbal Medicinal Product Committee (HMPC) at the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has summarized the adverse drug reactions of herbal medicines made from cimicifuga with mentioning allergic skin reactions (urticaria, itching, exanthema), facial oedema and peripheral oedema, and gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e. dyspeptic disorders, diarrhoea).Studies on the long-term safety of using herbal medicines made from black cohosh are available. They do not show harmful effects on breast tissue, endometrium, or breast cancer survivors. In contrast, such studies have not been published for dietary supplements made from black cohosh. Most black cohosh materials are harvested from the wild. Lack of proper authentication and adulteration of commercial preparations by other plant species are risk factors in dietary supplements and a critical matter of quality control in herbal medicinal products holding a marketing authorization. Very high doses of black cohosh may cause nausea, dizziness, visual effects, a lower heart rate, and increased perspiration.Worldwide, some 83 cases of liver damage, including hepatitis, liver failure, and elevated liver enzymes, have been associated with using black cohosh, although a cause-and-effect relationship remains undefined. Millions of women have taken black cohosh without reporting adverse health effects, and a meta-analysis of clinical trials found no evidence that black cohosh preparations had adverse effects on liver function. Package leaflets of phytomedicines made from black cohosh caution that people with liver problems should not take it, although a 2011 meta-analysis of research evidence suggested this concern may be unfounded. In 2007, the Australian Government warned that black cohosh may cause liver damage, although rarely, and should not be used without medical supervision. Other studies concluded that liver damage from use of black cohosh is unlikely. The clinical picture is similar to an autoimmune hepatitis with centrilobular liver cell necrosis, which can be treated with corticosteroids.\n\nPhytochemicals and pharmacology\nThe rhizomes and roots of black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa rhizoma) contain diverse phytochemicals, particularly various saponins (triterpene saponins/triterpene glycosides such as actein) as well as cimifugic acids and other phenol carboxylic acids. The pharmacologically active substance comprises the total extract. In the past, estrogen-like properties were attributed to preparations from this herbal drug. However, formonetin\u2014a phytoestrogen compound (isoflavone)\u2014could only be detected in methanolic extracts and was not found in ethanolic or isopropanolic cimicifuga extracts. Today, an estrogen-like mechanism of action can be ruled out. Regarding the alleviation of menopausal symptoms, central nervous activity was suspected as early as 2003, and it has since been confirmed with preclinical and clinical data.\n\nSee also\nCaffeic acid\nFerulic acid\nList of unproven and disproven cancer treatments\nPhenylpropanoids\nTriterpenoids\nPassage 7:\nCrocosmia paniculata\nCrocosmia paniculata is a bulbous flowering plant that is native to eastern South Africa, Lesotho, and Eswatini, growing in wet areas by streams, marshes, and drainages. Plants reach 4 to 5 ft (1.2\u20131.5 m) tall, with lanceolate leaves and deep orange to orange-brown flowers. It is a popular ornamental plant.The plant has escape cultivation and become established in the wild in parts of the United Kingdom.The common name Aunt Eliza is derived from the former generic name Antholyza.In Lesotho, where it is native, the plant is used by the indigenous Sotho people as an antidiarrhoeal remedy, administered not only to humans, but also to cattle so afflicted.\nPassage 8:\nCimicifuga\nCimicifuga (bugbane or cohosh) was a genus of between 12 and 18 species of flowering plants belonging to the family Ranunculaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.\nThe genus is now generally included in Actaea.The name Cimicifuga means 'bedbug repeller'.\n\nSelected species\nCimicifuga americana\nCimicifuga arizonica\nCimicifuga biternata\nCimicifuga brachycarpa\nCimicifuga dahurica - Sheng ma in Chinese (Chinese: \u5347\u9ebb; pinyin: Sheng ma)\nCimicifuga elata\nCimicifuga europaea\nCimicifuga foetida\nCimicifuga heracleifolia - both used in TCM as Sheng ma in Chinese (Chinese: \u5347\u9ebb; pinyin: Sheng ma)\nCimicifuga japonica\nCimicifuga laciniata\nCimicifuga nanchuanensis\nCimicifuga racemosa\nCimicifuga rubifolia\nCimicifuga simplex\nCimicifuga yunnanensis\n\nIn pharmacology\nCimicifugae rhizoma - pharmacological term in herbal medicine (Cimicifuga/Actea root), translated as Sheng ma, Chinese herb\nPassage 9:\nActaea arizonica\nActaea arizonica is a species of flowering plant in the buttercup family known by the common name Arizona bugbane. It is endemic to Arizona in the United States, where it occurs in Coconino, Gila, and Yavapai Counties. Like some other species in genus Actaea, this plant was formerly included in the genus Cimicifuga.This rhizomatous perennial herb produces hairless stems up to 1.5 to 2 meters tall. The leaves are each made up of triple-lobed, toothed leaflets up to 17.5 centimeters long by 12.5 wide. They are borne on long petioles up to 35 centimeters in length. The inflorescence is a panicle with several long branches, growing erect or leaning. The flowers have five sepals, two of which are greenish and three of which are cream in color. There are sometimes white petals as well, but these are often absent. Flowering occurs in July and August. There are many stamens in each flower. The flowers are pollinated by three species of bumblebee, Bombus occidentalis, Bombus morrisoni, and Bombus huntii. If the flowers are not pollinated by insects, or if pollination is prevented, for example, by a heavy rain, the flowers undergo abortion. The fruit is a follicle that has \"a bottle-brush appearance,\" and \"the seeds resemble furry little bugs.\"This plant is endemic to central Arizona, where it grows in the ecotone between coniferous forest and the riparian zone. The elevation is about 5300\u20137000 feet. Some plants grow in canyons and some grow in very moist habitat such as seeps and springs on mountain slopes. The soils are rich with humus and are well-shaded. The type locality is Bill Williams Mountain in Coconino County. It shares its habitat with the Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida).\nPassage 10:\nActaea elata\nActaea elata (syn. Cimicifuga elata) is a species of flowering plant in the buttercup family known by the common name tall bugbane. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, where it can be found in British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon.\n\nDescription\nThis species is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial reaching a maximum height around 1.8 meters. It is hairy in texture, with some glandular hairs. The leaves are made up of many lobed, toothed leaflets which resemble maple leaves in shape. The inflorescence is a branching panicle up to 17 centimeters long. The panicle bears many flowers, each with five white or pink-tinged sepals, but no petals. The flower presents a spray of long white stamens. Blooming occurs from May or June to August. The fruit is a flattened follicle up to 1.2 centimeters long. The fruits are poisonous. The plant has an unpleasant scent.\n\nHabitat\nThis species grows in moist woods and forest habitat. It is mostly restricted to lower elevations and is more common on north-facing slopes. It is associated with the forest trees Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), red alder (Alnus rubra), and vine maple (Acer circinatum), and other forest plants such as oceanspray (Holodiscus discolor), hazelnut (Corylus cornuta), sword fern (Polystichum munitum), and snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus). Alpine enchanter's nightshade (Circaea alpina), herb robert (Geranium robertianum), and wall lettuce (Lactuca muralis) are indicator species for the plant, often growing alongside it. This species can dominate the forest understory where it is common. The plant may be found in old-growth forests. It prefers the shade of dense forests. It can tolerate some breaks in the canopy but not large-scale clearing, such as clearcutting. Some penetrating sunlight is beneficial for the plant during its reproductive season. Animals associated with the species include the mountain beaver (Aplodontia rufa), particularly in Canada. Depending on location, pollinators of the plant include bumblebees, other types of bees, beetles, and syrphid flies.\n\nDistribution\nThis species has a limited distribution in its range. Most occurrences are in southern Oregon, where the populations can be large. There are fewer occurrences in Washington. In British Columbia, the plant is only known from the far southern regions of the province, near the Chilliwack River. It is considered an endangered species in British Columbia. There are ten known populations in British Columbia, making up less than 5% of the global population of the plant.In 2004 a new variety of the species was named and defined, var. alpestris. This variety is endemic to southern Oregon and it differs from other members of its species by having scales along the lower stem, and often more pistils. It may also be found at higher elevations.Threats to this species include processes that threaten its home ecosystems, such as the old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest. Fire suppression, logging, road maintenance, and other forest disturbance, collection from the wild, and damage to pollinator populations can harm occurrences of the plant.", "answers": ["Crocosmia"], "incorrect_answer": "Cimicifuga biternata"}, {"input": "The Devonshire Club was named in honor of which British landowner and politician?", "context": "Passage 1:\nAlexander Baring, 4th Baron Ashburton\nAlexander Hugh Baring, 4th Baron Ashburton,  (4 May 1835 \u2013 18 July 1889) was a British landowner and Conservative Party politician.\n\nEarly life\nBaring was the son of Francis Baring, 3rd Baron Ashburton (1800\u20131868), and his wife Hortense Eugenie Claire Maret de Bassano (c.\u20091812\u20131882). His sister, Marie Anne Louise Baring, was the wife of William FitzRoy, 6th Duke of Grafton.His paternal grandparents were Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton and the American heiress Ana Louisa Bingham (whose father was U.S. Senator William Bingham). His father was the younger brother of Bingham Baring, 2nd Baron Ashburton and among his paternal relatives was Harriet Baring (wife of Henry Thynne, 3rd Marquess of Bath). His maternal grandfather was Hugues-Bernard Maret, duc de Bassano, the former Prime Minister of France.He was educated at Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford, graduating in 1857.\n\nCareer\nBaring was elected unopposed as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Thetford at a by-election in December 1857, filling the vacancy caused by his father's succession to the peerage. He was re-elected in 1859 and 1865, and held the seat until he succeeded to the peerage in 1868 on the death of his father.On 16 June 1864, Baring was appointed to be a Deputy Lieutenant of the County of Norfolk.

His father was the eldest son of Lord George Cavendish (later created, in 1831, the 1st Earl of Burlington, by the second creation), third son of the 4th Duke of Devonshire and Lady Charlotte Boyle, daughter of the 3rd Earl of Burlington and 4th Earl of Cork. His mother was the daughter of the 1st Baron Lismore.\nHe was educated at Eton and the University of Cambridge (Trinity College), attaining the position of Second Wrangler and the Smith's Prize for mathematics. He became known by the courtesy title Lord Cavendish of Keighley in 1831 when the earldom of Burlington was revived in favour of his grandfather.\n\nCareer\nCavendish was returned to parliament as the MP for Cambridge University in 1829, a seat he held until July 1831, when he was returned for Malton. He only sat for Malton until September of the same year and was out of the House of Commons until 1832, when he was returned for North Derbyshire. He succeeded his grandfather in the earldom of Burlington in 1834 and entered the House of Lords. In 1858, he also succeeded his cousin as Duke of Devonshire. He was Lord-Lieutenant of Lancashire from 1857 to 1891 and Lord-Lieutenant of Derbyshire from 1858 to 1891.Devonshire was Chancellor of the University of London from 1836 to 1856, Chancellor of the University of Cambridge from 1861 to 1891, and Chancellor of the Victoria University from 1880 to 1891. At Cambridge he endowed the Cavendish Professorship of Physics, and the building of the Cavendish Laboratory. He made vast (and ultimately unsuccessful) investments in heavy industry at Barrow-in-Furness, and had his nearby country house Holker Hall rebuilt in its present form after it was gutted by a fire in 1871. He was one of the original founders of the Royal Agricultural Society in 1839, and was president in 1870. On 26 July 1871, he was nominated a trustee of the British Museum.The 7th Duke inherited a considerable amount of property in Eastbourne from his grandfather, and from his wife Elizabeth Compton of Compton Place. He saw through the development of Eastbourne in the 19th century with its parks, baths and squares and is commemorated by a statue at the top of Devonshire Place. The Duke also played a part in the foundation of Eastbourne College, the local private school, by selling some of his land at a modest price to build the school on and commissioning respected architect Henry Currey to design the school chapel and College House (now the School House, a boarding facility).\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1829, Devonshire married Blanche Georgiana Howard (1812\u20131840), daughter of George Howard, 6th Earl of Carlisle, and the former Lady Georgiana Cavendish, sister of the 6th Duke of Devonshire, known as the \"Bachelor Duke\".  Blanche was the Bachelor Duke's favourite niece, and his fondness for the young couple who were his heirs may have contributed to his decision not to marry himself. He commemorated Blanche with an inscription in the Painted Hall at Chatsworth, which states that he completed his reconstruction of the house in the year of his bereavement, 1840, and by Blanche's Urn at the top of the Long Walk in the garden.

With his widowed mother, he moved home many times, spending much time at Doddington Place Gardens, Kent, which had been purchased by his grandfather and aunt in 1906.Educated at Eton College, Oldfield was commissioned as an officer in the Grenadier Guards in the latter stages of the First World War. In 1920, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge. While at Cambridge, he converted from Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism. He also took an interest in social matters, and began voluntary work at Toynbee Hall in the East End of London and joined the Labour Party in the early 1920s.At the 1929 general election he was elected as Member of Parliament for South East Essex. With the formation of the Second Labour Government he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Air, Lord Thomson. Thomson was killed when the R101 airship crashed on its maiden voyage in October 1930, and Oldfield returned to the backbenches.\nWith the formation of a National Government in August 1931, the parliamentary Labour Party was divided into two factions, with supporters of Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald forming the National Labour Organisation and the remaining MPs moving to the opposition benches. Oldfield chose to join the latter group, and when a general election was held in October 1931, was defeated along with most of his Labour colleagues. He attempted to regain the seat in 1935 without success.Earlier in 1931, Oldfield had been elected to the London County Council to represent Whitechapel and St George's. He remained a member of the council until 1958, later representing Stepney and was vice chairman in 1954\u20131955.With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Oldfield attempted to rejoin the armed forces, but was initially rejected due to his age. He eventually succeeded in enlisting as an able seaman in the Royal Navy. He finished the war with the rank of sub-lieutenant.In 1953, he married Jonnet Elizabeth Richards, and the couple moved to Doddington, Kent. There he created a mushroom farm while his wife worked on the gardens of Doddington Place. In 1964, he joined the Conservative Party and was elected to Kent County Council in the following year. He remained on the council until 1981.He died in Doddington aged 100 in December 1999, 68 years after leaving the House of Commons.

His father left Scotland to seek his fortune in the East as an officer of the East India Company and retired to Fern Lodge, Hampstead  after a successful military career.Miles was educated at Rugby School and at Balliol College, Oxford. Because he was related to George Head Head's wife he was given a job at Head's bank in Carlisle when he was 23. He worked at that bank until 1864 when the bank was merged with another and became a trader in corn in London.He was a Director of the London and North Western Railway and J.P. for Cumberland and Middlesex. In 1876 MacInnes acquired Rickerby Park at Carlisle. He had been adopted as heir to George Head Head and his wife who were childless.

Throughout its existence it was based at 50 St James's Street. The major Liberal club of the day was the Reform Club, but in the wake of the 1868 Reform Act's extension of the franchise, the waiting list for membership from the larger electorate grew to such an extent that a new club was formed to accommodate these new Liberal voters. The clubhouse was on the western side of St James's Street. The original intention was to call it the 'Junior Reform Club', along the model of the Junior Carlton Club formed in 1866, but complaints from the Reform Club's members led it to being named the Devonshire, in honour of its first chairman, the Duke of Devonshire, an aristocrat from a long line of Liberals.\nThe club was fortunate in obtaining the St James's Street premises of Crockford's Club, a renowned eighteenth century club which had closed down in 1845. The Devonshire did well in its first decade, but found itself in an awkward position from the 1880s upon the establishment of the National Liberal Club. With a further extension of the franchise in 1885, the much larger National Liberal was aimed at these new electors, and the Devonshire came to possess neither the prestige of Brooks's or the Reform, nor the broader appeal of the National Liberal. The Devonshire soon lost its political flavour.\nIn the 1960s the Golfers Club shared the premises using a club room at the back of the building and there was also a Masonic temple on site, catering for those lodges without premises.\nAfter a great deal of financial trouble in the 1970s (mirrored in many other clubs of the time, including the Reform, the Carlton, the St James's, the United University, the Junior Carlton, the Army and Navy, and the United Service Club), it finally closed in 1976, with its membership being absorbed by the East India Club.\n\nFurther reading\nHenry Turner Waddy, The Devonshire Club and Crockford's (E.

The park is dedicated to California\u2019s third capitol building, where the California State Legislature convened from February 3, 1853 to February 24, 1854, when they voted to move the state capital to Sacramento. It is the only pre-Sacramento capitol that remains. The park includes the Fischer-Hanlon House, an early Benicia building that was moved to the property and converted into a home in 1858, after the legislature departed. Benicia Capitol State Historic Park just off the city's main street also includes a carriage house, workers' quarters and sculptured gardens.\n\nHistory\nFollowing large complaints by state legislators of inadequate furniture and sleeping quarters in Vallejo, California in early 1853, the Legislature, with the consent of Governor John Bigler, relocated the state capital to nearby Benicia that same year. The Legislature would convene in the Benicia City Hall for a little more than a year, when again complaints over poor weather conditions, inadequate and uncomfortable sleeping quarters, and \"the insecure condition of the public archives\" arose in January 1854.\nAfter a proposal by Sacramento to use the Sacramento County Courthouse free of charge as a capital building, the Assembly and Senate passed an enabling act, voiding all previous legislation, to move the state capital to its new location upriver in Sacramento. On February 25, 1854, Governor Bigler signed the act into law, moving the capital to its current location. The Legislature and governor climbed aboard the steamship Wilson G. Hunt to take up its new quarters. \"So much opposed to the removal were the good people of Benicia,\" the Sacramento Union reported, \"that the owners of the wharves, it is stated, refused to permit the steamer ... to land to take on the legislative furniture, unless she would pay $500.\" This request was refused and the furniture was shipped from a different wharf.The Greek Revival-Palladian building was listed as a California State Historic Landmark on January 11, 1935. The National Register of Historic Places placed the Benicia capitol on the federal list on February 12, 1971.\n\nPresent day\nThe original building has been restored with reconstructed period furnishings and exhibits.

It also was placed on the Governor's list of two hundred parks to close in fall of 2009 in response to the ongoing budget crisis and was on Jerry Brown's 2011 list of 70 proposed state park closures in the continuing budget crises.In March 2013, then-Director of California Department of Parks and Recreation, Anthony L.

The Oakland Press wrote a favorable review for Muffin Top, stating that \"most readers have probably never heard of this movie, which I think is a shame.\" The Windy City Times commented upon the film's central focus on women, which they felt was \"one of the reasons The Babadook and why actor-writer-director Cathryn Michon's comedy Muffin Top: A Love Story are such refreshing finds.\"The Star Tribune wrote a mixed review, criticizing it for utilizing vignettes while also encouraging viewers to support the flawed lead heroine while laughing at her unbearable dates. However they also stated that while the film did not match up to female oriented films like Bridesmaids, it was also \"tolerably funny\" and deserved a B for effort. A reviewer for Chicagoist panned Muffin Top and included it in their \"worst of the year\" list, writing \"Made with obvious good intentions, the indie comedy Muffin Top: A Love Story has little else going for it. Its basic plea for women to not allow their self-esteem to be damaged by unrealistic, media-enforced notions of an ideal body is a welcome message. Unfortunately, it is delivered via a frequently irritating and laugh-free feature made almost bearable by some talented cast members.\"", "answers": ["My Boss, My Hero"], "incorrect_answer": "My Boss, My School"}, {"input": "Dance and Laugh Amongst the Rotten is a studio Album by a band from which country ?", "context": "Passage 1:\nLaugh Now, Laugh Later\nLaugh Now, Laugh Later is the eighth studio album by American punk rock band Face to Face, which was released on May 17, 2011, through Antagonist Records, a label run by the band's lead singer and guitarist Trever Keith.

Their style is characterized by prominent usage of orchestral arrangements, black (sometimes death) metal vocals, and guitar riffs. Their studio albums are concept albums with lyrics based on ghost stories and folklore, such as the Flying Dutchman. The band sets itself apart from other symphonic black metal artists with the usage of multiple languages such as English, French, German, and Dutch. Most songs are based on English, with transitions into other languages during chorus and bridge sections.\nDrummer Ivo \"Namtar\" Wijers quit the group in February 2020, leaving the band with two current members, singer Seregor and keyboardist Clemens \"Ardek\" Wijers.\n\nName\nThe name \"Carach Angren\" is derived from J. R. R. Tolkien's  The Lord of the Rings and means \"Iron Jaws\" in the Elvish language of Sindarin. In the Tolkien universe, \"Carach Angren\", also called \"Isenmouthe\" (both meaning the same) is the name of a fortified pass into the plateau of Gorgoroth in North-Western Mordor.\n\nHistory\nCarach Angren was formed in 2003, in the Dutch municipality of Landgraaf, after two members of Vaultage, Lee Hartney and Inger Indolia, started a side project based on their shared love of legends and black metal. Eventually, Carach Angren was more successful, so both stepped down from Vaultage.\nIn 2004, Carach Angren released their first EP, The Chase Vault Tragedy. The EP is a concept album, telling the story of mysteriously moving coffins known as the Chase Vault Mystery. In 2005, the band released a second EP, Ethereal Veiled Existence, covering the story of the Brown Lady. In 2007, Carach Angren was signed to Maddening Media, a German independent record label. Carach Angren recorded their first full-length album for this label, Lammendam, which received positive international reviews following its release in 2008.Their second album, Death Came Through a Phantom Ship, was released on 26 February 2010.

This concept album covers themes surrounding war, including war, death, and suffering. \nOn 17 February 2015, the band's fourth album, This Is No Fairytale was available for streaming on Metal Hammer. The album was officially released on 23 February 2015. The album is a modern interpretation of the Hansel and Gretel fairy tale with themes of domestic abuse, drug addiction, alcoholism, sexual child abuse, suicide, child abduction and cannibalism.\nOn 16 June 2017, their fifth studio album, Dance and Laugh Amongst the Rotten, was released. This album diverges from the previous \"storytelling\" theme of the previous albums, but remains a concept album, with ghost themes, including the Blood Queen and Charles Francis Coghlan.On 10 February 2020, drummer Ivo \"Namtar\" Wijers left the band. According to him, the departure was motivated by \"dissatisfaction with the music industry\". Seregor and Ardek posted the announcement on the band's official website, revealing that the exit was a friendly one, saying, \"Although we are very sorry for your departure, we respect your decision\".\nIn late 2019 the band announced they had begun work on a sixth studio album, scheduled to be released in mid-2020. Its name and release date were unveiled on 20 February 2020; Franckensteina Strataemontanus.

Their second album, Join the Army, was released four years later and peaked at number 100 in the United States and number 81 in the UK. The album caught the attention of Epic Records, who signed Suicidal Tendencies in 1988. The band released their first album for the label, How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can't Even Smile Today, in September 1988, and in the following year they released Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit... D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, which was their first album to be certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).Suicidal Tendencies released their fifth album Lights...Camera...Revolution! in July 1990, which peaked at number 101 on the Billboard 200 and number 59 in the UK.

Four singles were released to promote The Art of Rebellion, including \"Nobody Hears\" and \"I'll Hate You Better\", which peaked at number 28 and 34 respectively on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. After releasing Still Cyco After All These Years (1993), a re-recording of their first album, Suicidal Tendencies released their eighth studio album Suicidal for Life in 1994. Despite being the band's second highest-charting album in the US, peaking at #82, Suicidal for Life was not as successful as their previous releases, and eventually after touring in support of it, Suicidal Tendencies broke up.\nSuicidal Tendencies reformed in 1996, and the compilation album Prime Cuts and split album Friends & Family, Vol. 1 were both released in the following year. They released one EP in 1998, which was followed by Freedumb (1999), their first studio album in five years. After the release of their next album, Free Your Soul and Save My Mind, in 2000, Suicidal Tendencies went on hiatus again and would not release their next studio album until No Mercy Fool!/The Suicidal Family in 2010, which contains mostly re-recordings of Suicidal Tendencies and No Mercy songs. No Mercy Fool!/The Suicidal Family was followed three years later by 13 (2013), which became Suicidal Tendencies' first album to chart on the Billboard 200 since Suicidal for Life but peaked at number 187, making it their second lowest chart position to date. The band's next studio album, World Gone Mad, was released on September 30, 2016, and received their lowest chart position to date on the Billboard 200, peaking at number 192.

The album, released in August 2000 by Dig Music, was recorded in February 1974 near Sacramento, California, shortly after it was announced that the band had reunited. The album includes a mix of performances of their most commercially singles, including \"Laugh, Laugh\" and \"Just a Little,\" as well as then-new material, some of which would be recorded for the band's 1975 eponymous studio album.\n\nBackground\nIn February 1974, Billboard magazine reported that the Beau Brummels re-formed in San Francisco. \nThis followed a five-year hiatus in which individual band members\u2014vocalist Sal Valentino, guitarist Ron Elliott, rhythm guitarist Ron Meagher, bassist Declan Mulligan and drummer John Petersen\u2014pursued solo projects, participated in recording with other artists, or both in some cases. Within days of the announcement, the band performed at the Shire Road Pub in Fair Oaks Village near Sacramento, California. \nThe tapes from these shows represent the only existing concert recordings in the band's discography.\n\nMusic\nLive! includes performances of the band's four highest-charting U.S. singles: \"Laugh, Laugh,\" \"Just a Little,\" \"You Tell Me Why,\" and \"Don't Talk to Strangers.\" The album also includes renditions of \"Nine Pound Hammer,\" a Merle Travis original which the band performed on their 1967 Triangle album, and \"Turn Around,\" a track from the band's 1968 Bradley's Barn album. The remaining 13 songs were new compositions at the time of recording, 11 of which were written or co-written by Ron Elliott. In addition, Ron Meagher (\"Lonely People\") and Declan Mulligan (\"Lisa\") each contributed one song. A handful of the new tracks were re-worked for and appeared on the band's 1975 eponymous studio album, as was the band's 1965 single \"You Tell Me Why.\"\n\nRelease and reception\nReleased August 29, 2000, Live! was the debut release by Dig Music, a music label based in Sacramento. \nThe label's owners\u2014Marty DeAnda, Jeff Hughson, and Dennis Newhall\u2014licensed the material from the band, and ensured the performances were not recorded during the time when the Beau Brummels were under contract to Warner Bros. Records. \nHughson noted that as a result of the album, the band \"reunited to perform at San Francisco\u2019s BayPop 2000, then went on to play more dates in New York for us.\" He added, \"Plus Ron Elliott started writing again. He had not written songs in 18 years, and as a result of listening to these tapes and getting enthused again, we got him back into it.\"In his review of the album, Rolling Stone writer Charles Bermant said, \"the best material here is the spirited and melodic 'new' songs, driven by Sal Valentino's pure voice and (former bassist) Declan Mulligan's spry lead guitar.\" \nBermant also noted Elliott's incorporation of bossa nova and reggae into the band's style.Allmusic writer Bruce Eder said that while Live! is a \"decent\" album, \"it isn't remotely the revelation that one would expect or wish for -- the producers might at least have been more honest by foregoing the exclamation point.\"\n\nTrack listing\n\"Nine Pound Hammer\" (Travis) \u2014 3:52\n\"You Tell Me Why\" (Elliott) \u2014 3:34\n\"Turn Around/Singing Cowboy\" (Elliott, Durand) \u2014 8:01\n\"Gate of Hearts\" (Elliott) \u2014 3:18\n\"Lonely People\" (Meagher) \u2014 4:19\n\"Music Speaks Louder\" (Elliott) \u2014 2:49\n\"Lisa\" (Mulligan) \u2014 3:01\n\"Tennessee Walker\" (Elliott) \u2014 4:34\n\"Don't Talk to Strangers\" (Elliott, Durand) \u2014 2:21\n\"Laugh, Laugh\" (Elliott) \u2014 3:15\n\"Lonesome Town\" (Elliott) \u2014 3:09\n\"Free\" (Elliott, Engle) \u2014 3:45\n\"Man and Woman Kind\" (Elliott, Engle) \u2014 4:50\n\"Restless Soul\" (Elliott) \u2014 3:29\n\"Her Dream Alley\" (Elliott) \u2014 2:34\n\"City Girl\" (Elliott, Engle) \u2014 3:29\n\"Paper Plane\" (Elliott) \u2014 2:59\n\"Just a Little\" (Elliott, Durand) \u2014 2:51\n\"Love Can Fall\" (Elliott, Engle) \u2014 4:47\nPassage 10:\nDance and Laugh Amongst the Rotten\nDance and Laugh Amongst the Rotten is the fifth studio album by Dutch symphonic black metal band Carach Angren. It was released on June 16, 2017 via Season of Mist. Although the album doesn't follow a linear story as their previous albums did, it is still a concept album. Clemens \"Ardek\" Wijers describes the album's concept as visitations from multiple ghosts of the dead; including the \"Blood Queen\" and Charles Francis Coghlan. The full album is focused on a nameless girl who plays with a Ouija board causing her to raise a variety of spirits and ends up getting possessed. The album ends by informing the listener that the box the CD came in is haunted by these same spirits, and that by opening the album, the listener has also released them.\n\nTrack listing\nComposed by Ardek.\nGuitars written by Ardek (tracks 5 to 9) and Seregor (tracks 2 to 9).\nLyrics by Ardek (tracks 3, 5, 7 & 9) and Seregor (tracks 2, 4, 6 & 8)\nViolin written by Ardek (tracks 3 to 9)\n\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.\nCarach Angren\n\nDennis \"Seregor\" Droomers \u2013 guitar, sound effects, vocals, backing vocals on \"Opening\"\nClemens \"Ardek\" Wijers \u2013 guitar, bass, keyboards, orchestral arrangements, orchestration, violin, backing vocals on \"Opening\"\nIvo \"Namtar\" Wijers \u2013 drums, sound effectsAdditional musiciansPatrick Damiani \u2013 guitar, bass, guitar engineer\nNikos Mavridis \u2013 violin (tracks 3 to 9)TeamCostin Chioreanu \u2013 artwork, design\nJonas Kjellgren \u2013 mastering\nPeter T\u00e4gtgren \u2013 mixing, drum engineering\nSylvy Notermans \u2013 proof reading\nErik Wijnands \u2013 lyric consultant\n\nCharts", "answers": ["the Netherlands"], "incorrect_answer": "Finland"}, {"input": "What Australian Electoral Division in New South Wales created in 1906 covers suburbs like Alexandria?", "context": "Passage 1:\nAustralian Electoral Commission\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is the independent federal agency in charge of organising, conducting and supervising federal Australian elections, by-elections and referendums.\n\nResponsibilities\nThe AEC's main responsibility is to conduct federal elections, by-elections and referendums. The AEC is also responsible for the maintenance of up-to-date electoral rolls, devising electorate boundaries, apportionments and redistributions. Under the Joint Roll Arrangements, the AEC maintains electoral rolls for the whole of Australia, other than Western Australia, which is used by the state and territory Electoral Commissions to conduct their elections. The AEC publishes detailed election results and follows up electors who had failed to vote or who have voted multiple times in an election.\nThe AEC is also responsible for registering political parties intending to field candidates at federal elections, monitoring the activities of those political parties, including receiving returns from parties of donations and expenditures, and the publication of the information. The AEC also plays an electoral education role, aiming to educate citizens about the electoral process by which representatives are elected, and by which the Australian Constitution is changed (referendums). It also plays a role in industrial voting and protected action ballots (e.g., votes on industrial action).\nThe rules for federal elections are contained in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, while the rules for referendums are contained in the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984.\n\nRegistration of political parties\nThe formal registration of political parties in Australia commenced in New South Wales in 1981 and 1984 for the Commonwealth. The AEC is required to maintain a register of political parties. Such registration is required before a party can field candidates, receive public funding, have party identification on ballot papers and use above-the-line ticket voting.In all jurisdictions, conditions relating to a party name require party names to have a maximum of six words, not be obscene and not to resemble the name of another, unrelated party, be likely to cause confusion with another party nor contain the word 'independent' or 'independent party'.\nAll Australian jurisdictions also have a minimum membership requirement, which differs widely, especially when compared with the total number of people enrolled in the jurisdiction. These range from 100 in the ACT and Tasmania, 200 in SA, 500 in Vic and WA, 1,500 for the Commonwealth and 750 in New South Wales. Four jurisdictions require a fee for registration: $500 for the Commonwealth, Victoria and the Northern Territory; and $2,000 for New South Wales.\n\nPublic funding of political parties\nSince 1984, Australian political parties have been publicly funded by the AEC. The objective of public funding is to reduce the influence of private money upon elections, and consequently, the influence of private money upon the shaping of public policy. After each election, the AEC distributes a set amount of money to each political party, per vote received. A candidate or Senate group needs 4% of the primary vote to be eligible for public funding.After the 2013 election, political parties and candidates received $58.1 million in election funding, with the funding rate being 248.800 cents per vote. The Liberal Party received $23.9 million, as part of the Coalition total of $27.2 million, while the Labor Party received $20.8 million. Other significant recipients were Australian Greens with $5.5 million, Palmer United Party with $2.3 million, and Liberal Democratic Party with $1.0 million.In 2016, $62.7 million was distributed, with the funding rate being 262.784 cents per vote.\n\nElectoral roll\nOne of the functions of the AEC is the maintenance of the electoral roll, which in some other countries are called electoral registers. In Australia voter registration is called \"enrolment\". The AEC maintains Australia's federal electoral roll, which is used for federal elections, by-elections and referendums. Australia has maintained a permanent federal electoral roll since 1908 and, by amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act, enrolment has been compulsory for federal elections since 1924. The requirement to register then applied to \"British subjects\" over the age of 21.\nThough each state and territory also has its own electoral commission or office, voters need to register only with the AEC, which shares the registration details with the relevant state electoral commission. The federal roll also forms the basis of state (except in Victoria and Western Australia, which maintain their own rolls) and local electoral rolls.AEC registration covers federal, state and local voter registration. In Australia and in each state and territory, it is a legal offence to fail to vote (or, at the very least, attend a polling station and have one's name crossed off the roll) at any federal or state election, punishable by a nominal fine. The amount varies between federal and state elections. (The fine for not voting is currently A$75.00 in Victoria. This figure is indexed at the beginning of every financial year.) Usually people are issued with warnings when it is found that they have not voted, and they are given an opportunity to show cause. Acceptable reasons for not voting may include being in the accident department of a hospital, being ill (requires confirmation), being out of the country on election day, religious objections, being incarcerated, etc. \"I forgot\" is not considered acceptable and will incur a fine. Section 245 of the Electoral Act (Cwth) provides that if an elector has been asked the \"true reason\" for his failure to vote states that he did not do so because it was against his religion, this statement shall be regarded as conclusive, and no further action will be taken.\nTraditionally, voters cannot register within three weeks of an election. In 2004 the Howard government passed legislation that prevented registration after 8 pm on the day that the writs were issued (this can be up to 10 days after the election has been announced). This legislation was considered controversial by some Australians who contended it disenfranchised first-time voters or those who have forgotten to update their enrolment. The law was repealed just before the 2010 federal election, after advocacy group GetUp! obtained a High Court ruling that the changes were unconstitutional. 16 and 17 year olds can provisionally enrol and are able to vote when they turn 18.\n\nHistory and structure\nThe Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902 set up the framework for the Commonwealth electoral system, which was administered until 1916 as a branch of the Department of Home Affairs, then until 1928 by the Department of Home and Territories, back to Department of Home Affairs until 1932 and then Department of the Interior until 1972. The Australian Electoral Office was created in 1973 by the Australian Electoral Office Act 1973. On 21 February 1984 the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) was established as a Commonwealth statutory authority.\nThe AEC is answerable to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters of the Parliament of Australia, and must report on how elections were carried out and the success of elections in general.\nThe AEC was created by and operates under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. It consists of a chairman (a judge or a retired judge of the federal court), the electoral commissioner and a non-judicial member (usually the Australian Statistician). The electoral commissioner has the powers of a secretary of a department under the Public Service Act 1999 and the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1998. The chairperson and the third, non-judicial member both hold their offices on a part-time basis.\nEach House of Representatives electorate has a Divisional Returning Officer responsible for administration of elections within the division. Each State also has an Australian Electoral Officer responsible for administration of Senate elections. The AEC has a National Office in Canberra and an office in each State and Territory: Adelaide, Brisbane, Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney.\nAfter the loss of 1,400 ballots during the recount for the 2013 Western Australia Senate election and the subsequent 2014 special election, the AEC came under significant scrutiny, leading to the resignation of Commissioner Ed Killesteyn.\n\nList of Australian Electoral Commissioners\nSee also\nAlbert Langer\nElectoral system of Australia\nCompulsory voting\nGetup Ltd v Electoral CommissionerElectoral commissions of each state and self governing territory:\n\nAustralian Capital Territory Electoral Commission\nNew South Wales Electoral Commission\nNorthern Territory Electoral Commission\nElectoral Commission of Queensland\nElectoral Commission of South Australia\nTasmanian Electoral Commission\nVictorian Electoral Commission\nWestern Australian Electoral Commission\n\nNotes\nExternal links\nThe Australian Electoral Commission website\nThe Electoral Council of Australia and New Zealand website, the consultative council between the AEC, New Zealand, state and territory electoral authorities\nCommonwealth Electoral Act 1918\nReferendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984\nPassage 2:\nDivision of Cook (1906\u201355)\nThe Division of Cook was an Australian Electoral Division in New South Wales. The division was created in 1906 and abolished in 1955. The Division was named for James Cook, who explored the east coast of Australia in 1770. It was located in the inner suburbs of Sydney, taking in the suburbs of Alexandria, Redfern and Surry Hills. It has been a safe seat for the Australian Labor Party, but in the 1930s and 1940s it was fiercely contested between Federal Labor and Lang Labor factions of the party.\n\nMembers\nElection results\nSee also\nDivision of Cook\nPassage 3:\nDivision of Lang\nThe Division of Lang was an Australian Electoral Division in the state of New South Wales. It was located in the southern suburbs of Sydney, and was named after Rev. John Dunmore Lang, a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and advocate of Australian independence. It originally included the suburbs of Kogarah and Marrickville, but by the time it was abolished in 1977, it covered the suburbs of Lakemba and Belmore.  The Division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 75 divisions to be contested at the first Federal election.  It was held by the Labor Party for all but one term after 1928, and in its final form was very safe for that party.  It was abolished at the redistribution of 31 October 1977.\n\nMembers\nElection results\nPassage 4:\nDivision of Barrier\nThe Division of Barrier was an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales. The division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 65 divisions to be contested at the first federal election. It was named for the Barrier Ranges near the city of Broken Hill in western New South Wales. In 1901, it included Broken Hill, Wilcannia, White Cliffs and Tibooburra and the surrounding pastoral areas. In 1906, it gained Menindee, Wentworth from Riverina and in 1913, it gained Balranald and Deniliquin from Riverina. It was abolished in 1922 with Broken Hill, Wentworth and Balranald being transferred to Darling and Deniliquin transferred to Riverina. It was a very safe seat for the Australian Labor Party, although both its members left the ALP at the end their terms: Josiah Thomas to join the Nationalists, and Michael Considine (a radical socialist) to sit as an independent.\n\nMembers\nElection results\nPassage 5:\nDivision of Phillip\nThe Division of Phillip was an Australian Electoral Division in the state of New South Wales. It was located in the Sydney's eastern suburbs, and was named after Captain Arthur Phillip, captain of the First Fleet and first Governor of New South Wales. The Division included the suburbs of Bondi, Coogee, Kensington and Randwick.\nThe Division was proclaimed at the redistribution of 11 May 1949, and was first contested at the 1949 Federal election. It was abolished prior to the 1993 Federal election.  It was a marginal seat that from 1963 onward was held by the governing party of the day.\n\nMembers\n\n\n== Election results ==\nPassage 6:\nDivision of Bland\nThe Division of Bland was an Australian electoral division in New South Wales. The division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 65 divisions to be contested at the first federal election. It was abolished in 1906. It was named for Dr William Bland, a New South Wales colonial politician. Based in rural southern New South Wales, it included the towns of Narrandera, Young, Wagga Wagga and West Wyalong. Bland was held by Chris Watson, the first Leader of the federal parliamentary Labor Party and Australia's first Labor Prime Minister. When Bland was abolished in 1906, Watson transferred to South Sydney.\n\nMembers\nElection results\nPassage 7:\nDivision of Riverina\nThe Division of Riverina is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales.\nIt includes the city of Wagga Wagga.\n\nGeography\nSince 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state's representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.\n\nHistory\nThe division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 65 divisions to be contested at the first federal election, although it was abolished between 1984 and 1993, so has not been contested at every federal election. The division was named after the Riverina region in which it is located, though its modern borders do not correspond exactly with the Riverina region. The division covers a primarily agricultural, rural area with many small towns.\nIn the 1984 redistribution, the division was abolished and replaced by Riverina-Darling, but in the 1993 redistribution it was re-created.\nSince its re-creation in 1993, it has been a safe Nationals seat. Its first incarnation tilted toward the Nationals' predecessor, the Country Party, for much of its history, but was occasionally taken by Labor during high-tide elections. It was fairly marginal for most of the 1970s and early 1980s, when it included the strongly pro-Labor mining towns of Broken Hill and Cobar which have now been transferred to Farrer and Parkes.\nThe division is located in South-West rural New South Wales, generally following the Murrumbidgee River valley. It includes the larger city of Wagga Wagga, as well as the towns of Cowra, Forbes, Junee, Cootamundra, Temora, West Wyalong, Young, Tumut and Gundagai. The Sturt Highway runs along the length of the division, and it contains a large section of the Newell Highway.\nThe Division of Riverina also contains the major town of Parkes which has the same name as the bordering Division of Parkes.\nThe seat has previously been held by Al Grassby, Minister for Immigration in the Whitlam government. The current Member for Riverina, since the 2010 federal election, is Michael McCormack, former Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the National Party of Australia from 2018 to 2021.\n\nMembers\nElection results\nPassage 8:\nDivision of Maribyrnong\nThe Division of Maribyrnong is an Australian electoral division in the state of Victoria. It is located in the inner north-western suburbs of Melbourne. Suburbs include Aberfeldie, Airport West, Avondale Heights, Essendon, Footscray, Gowanbrae, Keilor East, Maribyrnong, Moonee Ponds, Niddrie, West Footscray and Tullamarine. Due to redistributions, the division has been slowly moving west and changed with the introduction of the  Division of Fraser in 2018. According to the 2011 census, Maribyrnong has the highest proportion of Catholics in any Commonwealth Electoral Division in Australia with 41.6% of the population.\n\nGeography\nSince 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state's representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.\n\nHistory\nThe division was proclaimed at the redistribution of 13 July 1906, and was first contested at the 1906 election. The division was named after the Maribyrnong River, which runs through it. A safe Labor seat for most of the first half of the 20th century, it became a marginal Liberal seat for most of the 1950s and 1960s, in part due to the influence of the Democratic Labor Party. Labor retook the seat in 1969, and for most of the time since then, it has been a comfortably safe Labor seat.\nProminent former members include James Fenton, a minister under James Scullin and Joseph Lyons; Arthur Drakeford, a minister under John Curtin, Frank Forde and Ben Chifley; and Moss Cass, a minister under Gough Whitlam. The current member for Maribyrnong since the 2007 election is the former National Secretary of the Australian Workers' Union and former Opposition Leader Bill Shorten.\n\nMembers\nElection results\nPassage 9:\nAlexandria, New South Wales\nAlexandria is an inner southern suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Alexandria is located 5 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district and is part of the local government area of the City of Sydney. The postcode is 2015.The rough boundaries of Alexandria are Botany Road to the east, Gardeners Road to the south, Mitchell Road and Sydney Park to the west, and Boundary Road to the north. It is approximately 3.5 km south of Central station.\n\nHistory\nThe Parish of Alexandria was established in 1835. The naming of Alexandria and neighbouring Waterloo commemorates the famous British Empire military and naval victories over Napoleon \u2013 the Battles of Alexandria and Waterloo.  The Iron Duke Hotel in Alexandria is itself named after the Duke of Wellington, as is Wellington Street in Waterloo. It was thought Alexandria may have been named after Princess Alexandra, Queen consort of King Edward VII, however, Alexandra was born on 1 December 1844 and the parish's naming predates the birth of Alexandra by six years.\nIn 1868, the Municipality of Alexandria was formed, after separating from Waterloo. The former Alexandria Town Hall is in Garden Street. Land for the building was acquired in 1879; the building was designed by Ferdinand Reuss Snr and completed in 1881. Major alterations took place over the years, right up to 1928. The building is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register.By 1943, Alexandria was the largest industrial district in Australia, and known as the \"Birmingham of Australia\", with everything from bricks to aeroplanes manufactured in 550 factories in just 1,000 acres (4.0 km2). The municipality was abolished upon merger into the City of Sydney in 1949, along with Darlington, Erskineville, Newtown, Redfern, Waterloo, Paddington and The Glebe.\nIn 1968 the boundaries were changed again and Alexandria was part of a new municipality, South Sydney Council. South Sydney was brought back into the City of Sydney in 1982 and then became separate again under the City of Sydney Act of 1988. In 2004, Alexandria moved back into the City of Sydney, when the City of Sydney was merged with the City of South Sydney.\n\nTrams\nThe former Alexandria tram line opened in 1902 as a single-track electric line that was duplicated in 1910. The line branched off from the Botany line at the junction of Henderson and Botany Roads in Alexandria. The line proceeded down Henderson Road then swung left into Mitchell Road. A turn-back was provided at Ashmore Road (near Erskineville Oval) for short working. The line turned right into the present day Sydney Park Road (then known as an extension of Mitchell Road) before terminating at the junction with the Cook's River line at the Princes Highway near St Peters railway station. Services operated from Circular Quay in a route similar to the Botany line as far as the Henderson Road junction.  The line was closed in 1959. Transit Systems route 308 generally follows the route as far as St Peters station.\n\nHeritage listings\nAlexandria has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\nAlexandra Canal\n39 Brandling Street: Enginemans Resthouse\n16-22 Retreat Street: Yiu Ming Temple\n\nDemographics\nAt the 2021 census, there were 9,649 people living in Alexandria.At the 2016 census, Alexandria had a population of 8,262. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 1.7% of the population. The most common ancestries in Alexandria were English 22.6%, Australian 17.5%, Irish 10.8%, Scottish 6.9% and Chinese 5.8%. 59.0% of people were born in Australia. The most common other countries of birth were England 5.4%, New Zealand 3.7%, China (excludes SARs and Taiwan) 2.6%, Ireland 1.3% and the United States 1.0%. 72.1% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 2.7%, Cantonese 1.7%, Spanish 1.6%, French 1.3% and Italian, 1.0%. The most common responses for religion in Alexandria were No Religion 49.6%, Catholic 18.3%, Anglican 5.8% and Buddhism 2.8%. 61.3% of residences were flats and 34.1% were semi-detached, row or terrace house, townhouse etc.\n\nCommercial area\nAlexandria is a largely industrial suburb with medium to high density residential areas. The suburb was once mostly terraced housing, that was demolished for light industrial use and warehousing which continues to this day. Pockets of quiet residential areas remain along the northern boundary of the suburb, adjoining Erskineville and Waterloo.\nVirgin Atlantic has its Australia offices on Level 3 Eastside in the Sydney Corporate Park in Alexandria.\n\nGreen Square\nAlexandria is part of the Green Square district, in the north east of the suburb, which is undergoing gentrification. This involves an urban renewal project that is constructing modern retail, business and medium-high density residential developments.\n\nSouth Sydney Markets\nEstablished in September 2009, its main purpose was to meet the community demand for local markets, providing fine produce and a venue for local handmade crafts. The children's activities kept the little ones entertained with face painting and a kids zoo. It was open every Sunday 10am - 3pm at 75-85 O'Riordan St Alexandria however, it has unfortunately been temporarily closed.\n\nTransport\nAlexandria is serviced by Transdev John Holland routes to the Sydney central business district. Alexandria is close to two railway lines on the Sydney Trains network. Green Square railway station, located on the north-eastern fringe, is on the Airport & South Line. Erskineville railway station and St Peters railway station are serviced by the Bankstown Line. Both are within easy walking distance, to the west of Alexandria.\n\nCulture\nAlexandria has the headquarters of the Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Australia and New Zealand.\nAlexandria is the location for a Chinese community centred on the Yiu Ming Temple in Retreat Street. The temple was heritage-listed in 1999, along with the terraced houses that line Retreat Street.\n\nSport and recreation\nSydney Park is a large recreational area on the western border. Alexandria Park and McKell Playground are situated on Buckland Street. Tennis courts and a cricket oval are located here. Erskineville Oval is just over the western border. Erskineville Oval is the home ground of the Alexandria Rovers junior rugby league team. The Alexandria Dukes Rugby Football Club play in the New South Wales Suburban Rugby Union competition and will again contest the Meldrum Cup in 2014.  The club rooms for the Dukes are at the Iron Duke Hotel.\nA number of popular pubs are located in the suburb including the Alexandria Hotel (reopened), Iron Duke Hotel, Buckland Hotel and the Parkview Hotel on Mitchell Road.\n\nGallery\nPassage 10:\nDivision of Canobolas\nThe Division of Canobolas was an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales.

He was \"discovered\" while working at the BBC, sorting records for Desert Island Discs. A producer for the show heard him singing \"Questa o quella\" from Rigoletto while working, and suggested he study professionally.Rendall entered the Royal Academy of Music in 1970, and the Salzburg Mozarteum in 1973. He won a Young Musician of the Year Award from the Greater London Arts Association in 1973 and received a Gulbenkian Fellowship in 1975.

The switchblade-style knife that the Milwaukee opera company used failed to collapse, and the baritone received a 3-inch-deep (76 mm) cut into his abdomen. Julian recovered and police cleared Rendall of any wrongdoing.

He began his career as an actor at the Old Vic in his early 20s, excelling in the plays of William Shakespeare. During this time he also sang in the opera chorus. In 1923 he began to appear as a soloist with Lilian Baylis's opera company at the Old Vic; mostly in buffo roles. While there he met his future wife, operatic mezzo-soprano Edith Coates. The couple married in 1933 and often performed together.Lloyd remained with Baylis's company when they moved to the Sadler's Wells Theatre in 1931 and later became a producer and director for the company. Among the many roles he created on stage at Sadler's Wells were Bardolfo in Falstaff, Basilio in The Marriage of Figaro, Bobyl in The Snow Maiden, Goro in Madama Butterfly, Monostatos in The Magic Flute, Spoletta in Tosca, and Va\u0161ek in The Bartered Bride.

The song forms the centrepiece of The Snowman, which has become a seasonal favourite on British and Finnish television. The story relates the fleeting adventures of a young boy and a snowman who has come to life. In the second part of the story, the boy and the snowman fly to the North Pole. \"Walking in the Air\" is the theme for the journey. They attend a party of snowmen, at which the boy seems to be the only human until they meet Father Christmas with his reindeer, and the boy is given a scarf with a snowman pattern. In the film, the song was performed by St Paul's Cathedral choirboy Peter Auty; this performance was reissued in 1985 (on Stiff Records) and 1987.In 1985, an altered version was recorded for use in a TV advertising campaign for Toys \"R\" Us. While it was believed that Auty's voice had then broken, Auty claimed in an interview with BBC Breakfast News on 2 December 2022 that his voice had not broken and he was never contacted for the recording. Blake recommended the then-14-year-old Welsh chorister Aled Jones, whose recording reached number five in the UK Singles Chart, and who became a popular celebrity on the strength of his performance. The association of the song with Jones, combined with Auty not being credited on The Snowman, led to a common misbelief that Jones performed the song in the film.  \"Walking in the Air\" has subsequently been performed by over forty artists, in a variety of styles. In a UK poll in 2012, the Aled Jones version was voted 13th on the ITV television special The Nation's Favourite Christmas Song.\n\nNightwish version\nIn 1998, Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish covered the song for their second studio album, Oceanborn, in a power ballad style. A shorter version of it was released on 30 January 1999 as the second single from the album, featuring two b-sides. It spent eighteen weeks on the Finnish charts, peaking at number one for a week. The band named the compilation Walking in the Air: The Greatest Ballads after this song.\nThe song was performed regularly during Tarja Turunen's time with the band as the lead singer; after her departure, she went on to record her own version for her 2006 winter album Henk\u00e4ys Ikuisuudesta.\nNightwish's founding member and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen had stated that it is his all-time favourite piece of music.\n\nTrack listing\n\"Walking in the Air\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:41\n\"Nightquest\" (Tuomas Holopainen) \u2013 4:15\n\"Tutankhamen\" (Nightwish, Holopainen) \u2013 5:30\n\nOther notable recorded versions\nIn 1983, the British rock band Rainbow covered the song for their 7th studio album, Bent out of Shape. The song is called Snowman.\nAled Jones (as a teen boy soprano) reached number 5 in the UK Singles Chart in 1985 with his cover. He released it again, in a duet with himself (as an adult baritone), on his 2007 Album You Raise Me Up: The Best of Aled Jones. In 2022, Jones recorded a duet version with tenor Russell Watson, which was included on the Christmas with Aled and Russell album of the same year.\nChlo\u00eb Agnew (from Celtic Woman) in 2004 released her debut solo album titled Walking in the Air which hit number 13 on Billboard's Classical Albums Chart, and peaked at number 4 on Billboard's World Music chart. The song is the first track.\nDigital Dream Baby's \"Walking in the Air\", an electronic dance remix, peaked at number 49 in December 1991 in the UK's album chart.\nMcFly released their cover of the song on 2 December 2021. The single enjoyed a brief run on the UK Downloads chart, topping at number 25.\n\nUses in other media\nA parody version of it was used in a Scottish television commercial in 2006, for an Irn-Bru advert. It was reused in the advert's sequel in 2018.\nIt was used in a 2013 World Wide Fund for Nature commercial showing on YouTube, performed by Vaj\u00e8n van den Bosch.\nPassage 4:\nDavid Hillman\nDavid Hillman may refer to:\n\nDavid Hillman (tenor)\nDavid Hillman (politician)\n\nSee also\nDave Hillman, American baseball player\nPassage 5:\nJohn Mitchinson (tenor)\nJohn Leslie Mitchinson (31 March 1932 \u2013 17 December 2021) was an English operatic tenor.Mitchinson was born in Blackrod, Lancashire.

At the age of 13, he sang \"Walking in the Air\", the theme song of the 1982 animated film, The Snowman, but in the rush to finish the film his name was omitted from the credits until the film was remastered for its 20th anniversary in 2002.\nThe composer, Howard Blake, decided to re-record the song for a commercial for Toys \"R\" Us in 1985. Aled Jones was chosen instead and the song became a hit single. Many people assumed that Jones was the singer in the version used in the film.\n\nOpera singer\nAuty took the role of Camille in York Light Opera Company's production of The Merry Widow in 1995. Subsequently, he moved to the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama where he studied under Peter Alexander Wilson. At the summer performance in 1997 of Prokofiev's Betrothal in a Monastery (given as The Duenna), the Opera critic noted \"another potentially Wagnerian voice, the tenor Peter Auty, a very young-looking Don Jerome; the voice has that edge of smoky colour one associates with a Siegfried, but still has to settle into its own space and breadth\".Auty's professional stage debut was with Opera North in 1998. With the company, he subsequently sang the roles of Rodolfo in La boh\u00e8me during the 2001-02 season and Don Jos\u00e9 in Carmen in 2011. At Covent Garden he played the Major-Domo to the Marschallin in the 2000 run of Der Rosenkavalier under Thielemann, Michelis in the 2000 run of The Greek Passion under Mackerras, Flavio in Norma, Maintop in Billy Budd and a Shepherd in Tristan und Isolde in 2000, Roderigo in Otello, Gastone in La traviata and Third Esquire in Parsifal in 2001, Malcolm in Macbeth in 2002, and Arturo in Lucia di Lammermoor in 2003.Elsewhere in Britain he sang at Glyndebourne Festival Opera (Rodrigo in Verdi's Otello and Nemorino in Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore). His Don Jos\u00e9 for the Glyndebourne tour in 2002 was described as \"beautifully sung, deeply troubled\".There have also been roles with Scottish Opera and English National Opera. In other parts of Europe he has appeared in many other venues such as Frankfurt and Rouen. For the ENO Rigoletto in 2006, his Duke led a reviewer to comment that his \"brilliant top and equally sensitive shaping of lines made him a Duke of real distinction. On this and other recent showings, Auty is surely the finest lyric tenor in the Italian repertoire the UK has produced since the young Dennis O'Neill\".In 2018 he sang the \"exhausting\" title role in the stage premiere (and UK premiere) of Konstantin Boyarsky's Pushkin at Grange Park Opera. As the only non-Russian in the cast \"Auty coped heroically with Boyarsky's demanding vocal lines, and emphasized Pushkin's ardour and naivet\u00e9, nonchalantly delivering the many quotes (in Russian) that pepper the libretto.Auty has also performed concerts with orchestras both in his home country and abroad, such as London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir Colin Davis, Iceland Symphony Orchestra conducted by Vladimir Ashkenazy and Royal Flemish Philharmonic led by Edo de Waart.\n\nSelected discography\nDvo\u0159\u00e1k: Requiem, Op. 89 - London Philharmonic Choir & Orchestra Neeme J\u00e4rvi; 2009 (London Philharmonic Orchestra \u2013 LPO)\nBrian: Symphony No. 1 'Gothic' - BBC forces under Martyn Brabbins; 2011 (Hyperion)\nDonizetti: L'elisir d'amore (as Nemorino) - Glyndebourne Opera, Maurizio Benini (video); 2010 (Opus Arte)\nDvo\u0159\u00e1k: Stabat Mater, Op. 58 - London Philharmonic Choir & Orchestra, Neeme J\u00e4rvi; 2012 (LPO)\nElgar: The Dream of Gerontius - Royal Flemish Philharmonic, Edo de Waart; 2013 (Pentatone)\nVerdi: Rigoletto (as Borsa) - Royal Opera House Covent Garden, Edward Downes (video); 2013 (Opus Arte)\nJoubert: St. Mark Passion - Wells Cathedral Choir, Matthew Owens; 2017 (Resonus Classics)\nPassage 8:\nNicholas Sharratt\nNicholas Sharratt (born in Nottingham) is an English operatic tenor.\n\nBiography\nSharratt studied at the Royal Northern College of Music and the National Opera Studio.He has performed the title role in Orpheus in the Underworld for Scottish Opera and Ernesto in Don Pasquale for English Touring Opera.

When it was created 22 July 1918 with help from Pedro Pidal, 1st Marquess of Villaviciosa de Asturias, it covered the western part of today's national park, centered on the Lakes of Covadonga.\nThe Parque Nacional de la Monta\u00f1a de Covadonga, as it then was called, had an area of 169.25 km\u00b2. On 30 May 1995 and then on 3 December 2014, the park was extended to include its current total area of 671.27 km\u00b2.\nOn 9 July 2003, UNESCO approved Biosphere Reserve status for the National Park.  Picos de Europa is one of several biosphere reserves in the Cantabrian Mountains which are being integrated into a single super-reserve to be known as \"Gran Cant\u00e1brica\".\n\nGeography\nThe total area of the park is 671 km\u00b2 and is shared by  Castilla y Le\u00f3n, Asturias, and Cantabria. The highest point of the park is in Torre de Cerredo peak,  2,648 m AMSL and the lowest point is 75 m AMSL in the Deva River, that is, a vertical drop of 2,573 m.\nThe geological features of the park show the effects of glacial erosion on the limestone massifs that form the Cantabrian Mountains.\nThe human population is about 1300.Vega de Liordes, an enclave in the Le\u00f3n sector of Picos de Europa belonging to the municipality of Posada de Valde\u00f3n registered \u221235.8 \u00b0C (\u221232.4 \u00b0F), a record low temperature, on January 7, 2021.\n\nFlora and fauna\nSeveral types of woods can be found in the area; trees include beeches and Cantabrian Holm Oaks.\nThere are many protected animal species, like the Cantabrian capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus cantabricus), the Bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus), the Cantabrian brown bear and the Iberian wolf (Canis lupus signatus). The most representative animal of the Picos de Europa is the Cantabrian chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica parva) or rebeco, of which there are many sculptures around the park.\n\nSee also\nRedes Natural Park\nSan Glorio\nFlora of Cantabria\nPassage 9:\nNaranjo de Bulnes\nThe Naranjo de Bulnes (known as Picu Urriellu in Asturian) is a limestone peak dating from the Paleozoic Era, located in the Macizo Central region of the Picos de Europa, Asturias (Spain). Its name Picu Urriellu is believed to be derived from the term Los Urrieles, which is used to describe the Macizo Central. Naranjo de Bulnes is part of the Cabrales region of Asturias, and lies within the Picos de Europa National Park.\nThe first written reference to \"Picu Urriellu\" as \"Naranjo de Bulnes\" is credited to the German geologist and engineer, Wilhelm Schulz, who, in 1855, published the first topographic and geological map of Asturias. As far as is known the etymology of this name is not clear, because, historically, the local inhabitants always referred to the mountain as \"Picu Urriellu\". It has been suggested that the name can be attributed to the orange hue of the limestone from which the peak is formed. The local residents of Bulnes have a saying concerning the contentious name: \"No me llameis Naranjo, pues fruto no puedo dar, llamadme Picu Urriellu que es mi nombre natural\". (Don't call me Orange tree, because fruit I cannot bear, call me Picu Urriellu which is my natural name).\nIt has an altitude of 2,529 metres and although it is by no means the highest peak of the Cantabrian mountain range, it can be considered the best-known summit in the world of Spanish mountaineering, especially the 550m high vertical wall of the west face for big wall climbing. At its foot lies Vega Urriellu, a glacial valley from the quaternary period.\n\nHistoric ascents\nThis mountain was first scaled via the north face (by the route now known as the V\u00eda Pidal) on 5 August 1904 by Pedro Pidal, 1st Marquess of Villaviciosa de Asturias, accompanied by the shepherd Gregorio Perez, called \"El Cainejo\" based on his place of birth, Ca\u00edn in Le\u00f3n.The German geology professor and expert mountain climber Gustav Schulze made the second ascent of Urriellu on 1 October 1906, also via the north face, making him the first man to make the climb solo. He was also the first to use climbing pins to rappel down the south face. Accustomed to the large cliffs of the Alps and the Dolomites, Schulze described the climb as short and difficult.\nUsing the same face and route as Pidal, Victor Mart\u00ednez Campillo, a local of the nearby town of Bulnes, made the ascent on 31 August 1916. On this climb, Campillo recovered parts of the rope that Pidal and Perez had left attached to the rock during their descent from the peak. He made the same climb again on 22 September 1923, and on 19 August 1924, also opened a more gentle route, located to the left of the south face and now known as V\u00eda Victor.\nOn 7 July 1928, the mountaineer Andr\u00e9s Espinosa from Biscay scaled the south face alone without ropes. This was only the second climb of this kind on the mountain and the first at a national standard.\nOne month later, on 8 August, Manuel Martinez Campillo (a cousin of Victor) opened a new path known as the Horizontal Pass. This route was created to the right of the south face and has since become one of the most used routes.\nOn 13 August 1944, two sons of Victor Mart\u00ednez, Alfonso and Juan, opened the route on the south face known as the \"V\u00eda Sur\", or the \"Mart\u00ednez Direct Line\", which is one of the most used and safest routes.\nOn 23 March 1954, Antonio Moreno, Rafael Pell\u00fas, M\u00e1ximo Serna and Agust\u00edn Faus from the Pe\u00f1alara High Mountain Group tried to make the first winter climb. This attempt was called off due to the threat of avalanches. On 8 March 1956, \u00c1ngel Landa Bidarte from the Baracaldo Alpine tourism group and Pedro Udaondo from the Bilbao Juventus mountain group were the first to succeed in reaching the summit in winter conditions.\nOn 21 August 1962, the Aragonese mountaineers Alberto Rabad\u00e1 and Ernesto Navarro completed the first ascent via the difficult West Face.\nOn 8 February 1973, two parties, one formed by Miguel \u00c1ngel Garc\u00eda Gallego (from Murcia) and Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Lucas, and the other formed by C\u00e9sar P\u00e9rez de Tudela and Pedro Antonio Ortega (from Ardilla), made the first winter climb using the \"V\u00eda Rabad\u00e1 y Navarro\" on the West Face. This ascent was followed closely by the media as that winter had already claimed several lives and a few spectacular rescues had been required.\nOn 4 September 2009, the brothers Iker and Eneko Pou conquered Urriellu in 8 hours via the Orbayu route, a path with one of the most difficult cliff faces in the world with a gradient of 8c+/9a.\nThe \"Pand\u00e9bano Col\" can also be reached from the town of Bulnes; however, this town can only be reached using a footpath or the Funicula railway. Although the most direct way of getting to the \"Vega Urriellu\" from Bulnes would be along the Balcos\u00edn channel and the \"Majada de Camburero\", this path is more difficult.\n\nClimbing routes\nA list of the most important routes (most of which are for big wall climbing):\nWest Face\n-Rabad\u00e1 y Navarro (750m, MD+, 6a, A1 [6c+])\n-Leiva.

The team is a member of the America East Conference, which is part of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I. It plays home games at Varsity Field on the university's campus in Albany, New York. The Great Danes are coached by Jon Mueller.\n\nHistory\nAlbany's baseball program played its first season in 1958.  After spending several decades in Division III, it began the transition to Division I in the mid-1990s along with the school's other teams.\n\nDivision I\nIt played its first season in Division I in 2000, also hiring head coach Jon Mueller that year.  After competing as an independent in 2000 and in the New York State Baseball Conference in 2001, it played its first season in the America East in 2002.  In 2004, the Great Danes set a program record with 37 wins and reached their first Division I postseason, going 1\u20132 at that season's America East tournament.  In 2007, the team won the AEC tournament as the third seed to reach its first NCAA tournament at any level.  As the fourth seed at the Fayetteville Regional, Albany went 0\u20132, losing 9\u20130 to host Arkansas and 21\u201311 to second seed Creighton.\n\nYear-by-year results\nBelow is a table of Albany's yearly records as an NCAA Division I baseball program.\n\nMLB Draft\nAs of 2020, nine players have been selected from Albany in the Major League Baseball draft and none have reached the majors.

Stony Brook currently competes in the CAA and plays its home games on Joe Nathan Field. Matt Senk has coached the team since the beginning of the 1991 season. The team has won the America East tournament six times in 2004, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2015, and 2019. In 2011, the Seawolves claimed their first America East regular season championship. Stony Brook has participated in the NCAA tournament on six separate occasions, winning its first game in 2010.\nIn 2012, the Seawolves clinched their second consecutive regular season championship and their fourth America East Conference baseball tournament championship, earning the league's automatic bid to the 2012 NCAA Division I baseball tournament. The team went on to win the Coral Gables Regional and the Baton Rouge Super Regional, becoming the first ever team from the America East Conference to advance to the College World Series.\n\nHistory\nPre-Division I era (1966\u201398)\nStony Brook first fielded NCAA\u2013sanctioned baseball in 1966. The program struggled hard initially, posting only six winning seasons until the hiring of Matt Senk as head coach in 1991. Senk's leadership helped the team succeed at the Division III level, and Stony Brook finished 1995 with a 30\u20138 record and a trip to their first Division III NCAA tournament. Stony Brook shortstop Joe Nathan was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the sixth round with the 159th overall pick in the 1995 MLB Draft. He debuted for the Giants in 1999 as a pitcher, becoming the first player in program history to play in the MLB.\n\nEarly years in Division I (1999\u20132004)\nStony Brook began in Division I as a member of the Eastern College Athletic Conference. In 2002, the Seawolves joined the America East Conference. In 2003, Stony Brook advanced to its first America East Tournament title game, needing to beat Northeastern twice to win the championship. While they won 11\u201310 in game one, they were blown out 11\u20130, leaving them one game away from its first NCAA tournament berth. In 2004, the fourth-place Seawolves upset first-place Northeastern 15\u20136 in the first round of the America East Tournament, and advanced to the championship game for a second straight year, this time defeating Maine 3\u20131 to win their first America East championship and advance to their first NCAA tournament in the program's Division I history. Stony Brook was assigned as the fourth seed in the Kinston Regional, where they lost to host East Carolina 8\u20132 and Tennessee 1\u20130 and were eliminated from the tournament in two games.\n\nProgram on the rise (2005\u201311)\nAfter reaching their first NCAA tournament in 2004, Stony Brook followed up with its first losing season since 1997, not qualifying for the America East Tournament. Stony Brook suffered another losing season in 2006 and a quick elimination from the America East Tournament in 2007. On December 6, 2006, Joe Nathan's No. 22 was retired, becoming the first retired number in Stony Brook athletics history. In 2008, Stony Brook finished 34\u201326 (14\u201310 America East) in second place in the regular season behind the Binghamton Bearcats. In the double-elimination tournament, the Seawolves beat UMBC and Binghamton twice to clinch their second tournament championship and advance to their second NCAA tournament Regionals. In the Tempe Regional of the NCAA tournament, Stony Brook lost 9\u20137 to Arizona State and 9\u20134 to Vanderbilt, resulting in another early exit from the tournament.The 2009 season was less promising and the Seawolves ended the regular season in third place with a 29\u201323 (14\u201310) record. Stony Brook was ousted early in the America East tournament after consecutive losses against second-seeded Albany and fourth-seeded Vermont. In 2010, Stony Brook ended 30\u201327 (15\u20139), entering the tournament as the third seed but surprising with victories against Maine and consecutive victories against Albany to earn its third tournament championship. In the NCAA tournament, the Seawolves played in the Myrtle Beach Regional. They lost to Coastal Carolina 6\u20130, but defeated NC State 6\u20132 in the loser's bracket to earn their first victory in the tournament. The Seawolves were then eliminated in a rematch with Coastal Carolina, losing 25\u20137.In 2011, Nathan's donation allowed for the construction of a new venue, Joe Nathan Field, which was unsuitable for play entering the season. As a result, the Seawolves played their home games at Baseball Heaven in Yaphank, New York. Joe Nathan Field opened on May 20, 2011. Stony Brook won its first conference regular season title in 2011 after going 22\u20132 in America East play; the Seawolves ended with a program-record 42 wins and went 42\u201312. However, Stony Brook was upset twice in the America East Tournament, once by Albany and again by Maine to eliminate the Seawolves before reaching the title game, putting their record-breaking season to a stunning halt.\n\nCollege World Series run (2012)\nStony Brook opened its 2012 campaign with a perfect 4\u20130 weekend at Thibodaux, Louisiana, with a pair of victories over Alabama State and Nicholls State in the Colonel Round Robin. The Seawolves' only losses in conference play came against East Carolina in a sweep, Kansas, Minnesota, Yale and Holy Cross. When conference play started, Stony Brook was 17\u20138.\nStony Brook went 21\u20133 in conference play, losing two games to Binghamton and one to Albany. The Seawolves continued to earn non-conference wins against Iona, Marist, Rhode Island, Central Connecticut and Fairfield in the middle of the conference season, entering the America East tournament with a 43\u201311 record. Stony Brook beat Maine 14\u20136, Binghamton 7\u20134 and Maine 13\u20136 to win the conference title, advancing to the 2012 NCAA Division I baseball tournament with a 46\u201311 record, the best record in Division I.The Seawolves were the first team in the America East since 2002 to earn both the regular season and conference tournament championships in the same season. For the first time in the history of the program, Stony Brook found itself ranked, sitting at No. 25 in the Baseball America poll and No. 29 in the NCBWA poll.Stony Brook traveled to South Florida to play in the Coral Gables Regional as the fourth seed. In the first game the Seawolves knocked off top-seeded Miami and went on to the winner's bracket. Following a loss to second-seeded Central Florida, Stony Brook beat Missouri State in dramatic fashion, striking out Luke Voit in the bottom of the ninth with the bases loaded in a 10\u20137 win. The Seawolves topped Central Florida 12\u20135 and 10\u20136 in consecutive days to win the regional and advance to face the LSU Tigers in the Super Regionals.\n\nIn a rain-soaked Baton Rouge Super Regional, Stony Brook fell in the first game to LSU, who started pitcher Aaron Nola, in an extra-innings affair that spanned two days due to rain. In game two, LSU started pitcher Kevin Gausman, who had closed out the game one victory hours before, with Stony Brook winning 3\u20131 behind a 127-pitch complete game. In a winner-take-all game three, Stony Brook won 7\u20132 and advanced to the 2012 College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska. The Seawolves were the second team to be the fourth seed in its regional and advance to the College World Series. Stony Brook was the first Northeast school to reach Omaha since 1986 and the first school from New York to do so since St. John's in 1980.In the College World Series, Stony Brook's Cinderella run came to an end, losing to UCLA 9\u20131 and Florida State 12\u20132. Stony Brook ended the season with a 52\u201315 record, the most wins in college baseball, a No. 8 national ranking in the NCBWA poll and seven players selected in the 2012 MLB Draft, including outfielder Travis Jankowski being selected in the first round by the San Diego Padres.\n\nFinal America East years (2013\u20132022)\nStony Brook followed up its College World Series campaign with a disappointing 25\u201334 season, finishing fourth in the America East and being eliminated in the first two games of the tournament.

The mountain range is considered to be low altitude within Colorado as all of the peaks are under 11,000 feet (3,400 m). Located within Routt and Moffat counties, the Elkhead Mountains are far from metropolitan areas and have few lakes and streams, so they attract relatively few visitors.\nThe mountain range is of volcanic origin and all of the peaks were formed by volcanic action. The mountain range extends approximately 16 miles (26 km) east to west and 10 miles (16 km) north to south, and its center is located at 40.77404\u00b0N 107.32132\u00b0W\ufeff / 40.77404; -107.32132, approximately 20 miles (32 km) northeast of Craig and north of Hayden, Colorado, 13 miles (21 km) south of the Wyoming border.  Almost all of the peaks within the Elkhead Mountains are a part of Routt National Forest.  Significant peaks include Bears Ears, Sugar Loaf, Saddle Mountain, Black Mountain, Pilot Knob, and Meaden Peak.\n\nSee also\nPark Range (Colorado)\nMountain ranges of Colorado\nPassage 2:\nCrocker Range\nCrocker Mountains (Malay: Banjaran Crocker) is a mountain range extending from the West Coast until Interior divisions of Sabah, Malaysia that separates the west and east coast of Sabah. At an average height of 1,800 metres (5,906 ft), it is the highest mountain range in the state named after the British administrator in North Borneo, William Maunder Crocker.\n\nGeology\nThe mountain range is made up of uplifted and folded sedimentary rocks consisted of weathered soft sandstones and shales. The highest point is Mount Kinabalu at 4,095 metres (13,435 ft) . Most of the park boundary lies above 300 metres (984 ft) with its lowlands used for cash crops and paddy field. On the eastern side of the mountain range resides the Tambunan Valley at 800 metres (2,625 ft) which are mainly terraced paddy fields and groves of bamboos border the north-eastern part of the protected park. The park area is important as a water catchment to supply water into various river in the west coast and interior districts of Sabah including Papar River, Kimanis River, Bongawan River, Membakut River, Padas River and Melalap River that flow west to the park while the Pegalan River, Pampang River, Apin-Apin River, Tendulu River, Melalap River, Liawan River and Tikalod River flow the opposite direction.\n\nHistory\nThe area surrounding Mount Kinabalu has been a state park since 1964 and was the country's first World Heritage Site. Part of the mountain range has been gazetted for protection as Crocker Range National Park since 1984. Through the Bornean Biodiversity and Ecosystems Conservation Programme (BBEC), a technical co-operation existed between the government of Sabah and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to innovate Community Use Zone (CUZ) concept as a management option to address the issues concerning indigenous communities living and utilising resources within the protected areas. Mount Kinabalu, one of the highest mountains in Southeast Asia, is a part of this mountain range. In 2014, the range was recognised as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, becoming the second Malaysian site to be designated, after Chini Lake in the Malay Peninsula of Pahang.\n\nBiodiversity\nThe Crocker Mountains Forest Reserve area has a wide range of flora and fauna diversity and having the highest diversity of nocturnal insects in all the 20 forest reserves surveyed within the Heart of Borneo area in Sabah and recorded a number of endemic species.\nPassage 3:\nYutmaru Sar\nYutmaru Sar is a mountain in the Hispar mountain range, a subrange of the Karakoram. At an elevation of 7,283 m (23,894 ft) it is the 88th highest mountain in the world. Yutmaru Sar is located in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan-administered Kashmir. It was first climbed in 1980.\nPassage 4:\nRimo I\nRimo I is the main summit of the Rimo massif with an elevation of 7,385 metres (24,229 ft).\n\nGeography\nIt lies in the northern part of the remote Rimo Muztagh, a subrange of the Karakoram range. It is located about 20 km northeast of the snout of the Siachen Glacier and is the world's 71st highest mountain. Rimo means \"striped mountain\". The Rimo Glacier, originating here, drains to the Shyok river.\nDue to its remote location in the heart of the eastern Karakoram, Rimo was little-known and almost entirely unvisited until the twentieth century. Explorers Filippo De Filippi and Philip and Jenny Visser visited the area in 1914 and 1929 respectively. Adding to its isolation is the unsettled political and military situation between India and Pakistan in the region, especially on the nearby Siachen Glacier. This means that India controls access to the massif.\n\nRimo massif\nThe Rimo massif consists of six peaks sharing the Rimo name. In addition to Rimo I, they are:\n\nRimo II is a minor subpeak located about 150 m (490 ft) northeast of Rimo I, on its north ridge. The others are more independent peaks further north. Rimo III is the 98th highest mountain in the world (Rimo II is unranked, lacking sufficient prominence).\nThe massif heads the large Central Rimo Glacier (on the north side) and South Rimo Glacier (on the east side), as well as the smaller North Terong Glacier (on the west side).\n\nClimbing history\nThe first attempts on the Rimo massif were in 1978, by a Japanese expedition which had little success, in 1984 (first ascent of Rimo IV, by an Indian army expedition) and in 1985, by a well-organized Indian/British expedition led by famed Himalayan expert Harish Kapadia. That expedition climbed Rimo III (Dave Wilkinson and Jim Fotheringham were the summit party) but did not succeed on Rimo I.\nThe first, and so far only, the ascent of Rimo I was made in 1988 by an Indian/Japanese team led by Hukam Singh and Yoshio Ogata. They climbed the south face to the southwest ridge, starting from a significant pass called Ibex Col on the south side of the mountain. The ascent involved 1500m of significant technical climbing.\n\nSee also\nList of highest mountains\nHarish Kapadia\nPassage 5:\nKrucze Mountains\nThe Krucze Mountains (Czech: Vran\u00ed hory, German: Rabengebirge Polish: G\u00f3ry Krucze) are the Eastern part of the Stone Mountains, which belong to the Central Sudetes on the border of the Czech Republic and Poland. To the West and North-Western part the mountain range borders the Lubawska Plateau and the Karkonosze Mountains, to the North-Eastern part they border the mountain range Czarny Las, from the East they border the sediment basin Kotlina Krzeszowska and the Zawory mountain range and to the South the mountain range borders the Czech part of the Sto\u0142owe Mountains. To the Southern ridge of mountain range is the Polish-Czech border. The border crossing for cars is in Lubawka and for tourists is in Okrzeszyn.\n\nSpecification\nThe mountain range stretches North to South, which is irregular for the Sudetes Mountains, this is due to their geological build. To the very North of the mountain range is Ko\u015bcielna with a height of 513 metres, which is on the outskirts of the settlement of Kamienna G\u00f3ra. The most important highest peaks in the Northern part of the mountain range are: D\u0142ugosz at 612 metres, Anielska G\u00f3ra at 651 metres, Czarnog\u00f3ra at 621 metres, Kierz at 662 metres, Skowroniec at 581 metres,  Pustelnia at 683 metres,  \u015awi\u0119ta G\u00f3ra at 701 metres,  Krucza Ska\u0142a at 681 metres, Polska G\u00f3ra at 792 metres, Szeroka at 844 metres, G\u0142azica at 798 metres, Wi\u0105zowa at 800 metres, Jaworowa at 786 metres,  Owcza G\u0142owa at 753 metres,  Ko\u0144ska at 813 metres, Kobyla G\u00f3ra at 758 metres, Bogoria at 645 metres, Ja\u0144ski Wierch at 697 metres. On the Czech side of the mountain range, from the West of the border ridge is Kr\u00e1loveck\u00fd \u0160pi\u010d\u00e1k, the highest peak of the Krucze Mountains and Mraven\u010d\u00ed vrch at 836 metres.\nThe Ja\u0144skiego Wierchu Massif is separated from the Krucze Mountains by the Szk\u0142a Valley, and according to Czech geographers the Jest\u0159eb\u00ed hory mountain range.\n\nSettlements\nOn the Polish side of the mountain rangeB\u0142a\u017cej\u00f3w, B\u0142a\u017ckowa, Janisz\u00f3w, Kamienna G\u00f3ra, Lipienica, Lubawka, Okrzeszyn, Przedwoj\u00f3w and Uniemy\u015bl.\n\nOn the Czech side of the mountain rangeBe\u010dkov, Bernartice, Kr\u00e1lovec.\nPassage 6:\nPassu Sar\nPassu Sar (Urdu: \u067e\u0633\u0648 \u0633\u0631; or Passu Sar, Passu I) is a mountain peak in the Batura Muztagh, a sub-range of the Karakoram mountain range, in the Hunza District of Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. It is the high point of the Passu massif, which also includes Passu Diar (or \"Passu East\", \"Pasu II\"). The peak lies on the main ridge of the Batura Muztagh, about 7 km (4 mi) east of Batura Sar.\nThe date of the first successful ascent of Passu Sar is disputed. It has been reported as first climbed on 7 August 1994 by the German team of Max Wallner, Dirk Naumann, Ralf Lehmann, and Volker Wurnig. Another report claims it was climbed in 1978 by a Japanese-Pakistani team.\n\nSee also\nGojal\nPassu\nHunza\nList of mountains in Pakistan\nHighest Mountains of the World\nPassage 7:\nKanjut Sar\nKanjut Sar (Urdu: \u06a9\u0646\u062c\u062a \u0633\u0631), or Kunjudh Sar as pronounced in Wakhi, is a mountain located in the Shimshal Valley, part of the Karakoram mountain range. The name Kunjudh Sar in Wakhi means \"that which overlooks Kunjudh\", or \"above Kunjudh\", while Khujudh is the Wakhi name for Central Hunza. It is the 28th-highest mountain on Earth and the 11th-highest in Pakistan. According to many residents of Shimshal, Kanjut Sar is the name of the adjacent peak Yukshin Gardan Sar, and vice versa. In Shimshal village, the original namings are widely accepted and used, as opposed to what is recognised internationally.\nKanjut Sar consists of two peaks:\n\nKanjut Sar I at 7,760 metres (25,459 ft).\nKanjut Sar II, to the southeast of I, at 6,831 m (22,411 ft).Kanjut Sar I was first climbed in 1959 by Camillo Pellissier, member of an Italian expedition directed by Guido Monzino. Between 4 and 6 August 1981, seven Japanese climbers of the same expedition climbed to the top. In 2010, a Russian\u2013American expedition attempted to climb on the Eastern Ridge of Kanjut Sar and reached 7450 m, but turned back in bad weather.The first ascent of Kanjut Sar II was achieved by a Swiss team in 1985.  Expedition leader Toni Spirig, Ueli Stahel and Richie Ott finally carried it out in alpine style after several attempts . The climbers reached the summit on July 10. The ascent route led over the north-west side.\nOn July 29, 1990, a Dutch expedition made the second ascent of Kanjut Sar II in alpine style via the south face. Expedition members were Peter Kok, Frank Schmidt, Franck van den Barselaer, Hendrik Freie and Pieter de Kam.\n\nSee also\nHighest mountains of the world\nList of Ultras of the Karakoram and Hindu Kush\nList of mountains in Pakistan\nPassage 8:\nBashagard Mountains\nThe Bashagard Mountains or the Bashagerd Mountains (also known as Bashagird or Bashakerd) is a mountain range that is located in southeast of Iran. The mountain range runs in an arc almost in a northwest-southeast direction from eastern parts of Hormozgan Province along the border with Kerman Province and stretching into southern part of Sistan and Baluchestan Province. With an elevation of 2185 metres, Mount Buniken (Kuh-e Buniken) is the highest point of the range located in the western section of the Bashagard Mountains, east of Sardasht in Bashagard County in Hormozgan Province, and in the vicinity of a place that marks the borders of Kerman, Hormozgan, and Sistan and Baluchestan provinces. Made of ophiolite, an assemblage of mafic igneous rocks representing remnants of former oceanic crust, the mountain range was formed finally in the Miocene and the Pliocene during the Alpine orogeny. The mountain range is located in a region with a hot semi-desert climate.\n\nPeaks\nMorderaz\nPassage 9:\nMingli Sar\nMinglik Sar (Urdu: \u0645\u0646\u06af\u0644\u06cc \u0633\u0631) is a mountain located in the Shimshal valley in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan.   The mountain, located in the Karakoram mountain range, is 6050 meters high and located at the southernmost part of the Pamir mountain range. It was first climbed in 1988 by the famous Pakistani climber Nazir Sabir.  Shimshal lake sits at the base of the mountain. China is located to the north, while to the left is the Hindukush mountain range. K2 is located on the south eastern side of the valley.\nDespite being climbed many times in the summer, it is a nearly impossible task in the months before June. The snow is deep and it requires extreme mountaineering, climbing and alpine experience. It has been attempted several times for winter ascents but none have been successful.\nSummers are beautiful in the area and the base camp can be set close to the summit and several attempts can be made.\n\nGuinness World Records\nThe Guinness World Record for the world's highest altitude dance party and the world's highest altitude DJ set were performed on Miniglik Sar in July, 2020 at the height of 5,909 metres. This record was made by local musicians and mountaineers under the banner of Team Khimor, and was supported by HBL as a part of their CSR initiative. The team-members included Nosher Ali Khan Zapoo, DJ Ghasuray, Saad Ata Barcha, Zulqarnain Saleem, Ali Musa, Rameez Ahmed, Mohsin Kamal, Junaid Alam, Noman Asmet, and Misyab Khan (all hailing from Hunza, Pakistan).\nPassage 10:\nDistaghil Sar\nDisteghil Sar or Distaghil Sar (Urdu: \u062f\u0633\u062a\u0627\u063a\u0644 \u0633\u0631) is the highest mountain in the Shimshal Valley, part of the Karakoram mountain range in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. It is the 19th-highest mountain on Earth, the 7th-highest in Pakistan, and the first of the high peaks after Shishapangma to be the tallest independent summit of its own subrange. Disteghil sar is a Wakhi language word suggested by the Wakhi people of Shimshal, meaning \"above the inner ranch.\" The mountain has a 3-kilometre-long (1.9 mi) top ridge above 7,400 meters elevation, with three distinct summits: Northwest, 7885 m; Central, 7760 m; and Southeast, 7696m or 7535m.\n\nClimbing history\nDistaghil Sar was first climbed in 1960 by G\u00fcnther St\u00e4rker and Diether Marchart of an Austrian expedition led by Wolfgang Stefan. The expedition climbed the western part of the south face and continued over the southwest ridge to the highest summit. Three years earlier, in 1957, an English expedition had attempted to climb the mountain from the south and the west, but failed due to bad weather. Likewise, weather foiled a 1959 Swiss attempt over the southeast ridge.\nThe highest, western summit has been scaled twice since in 1980 and 1982 over the original route. Two attempts over the daunting north face, in 1988 and 1998, were unsuccessful. The eastern summit was first climbed in 1980 by a Polish expedition over the east face, and was reascended in 1983.\n\nSee also\nList of mountains in Pakistan\nHighest Mountains of the World", "answers": ["Karakoram mountain range"], "incorrect_answer": "Himalayan mountain range"}, {"input": "Name five actors that worked with a German cinematographer?", "context": "Passage 1:\nFight for Fame\nFight for Fame is a one-hour reality show produced by E!

The Company of Five ran for one series of six episodes.\n\nSynopsis\nA man walks through central London on his way to a job interview, perceiving his surroundings as resembling a zoo. He behaves oddly, bumping into people, speaking gibberish, and avoiding the cracks between paving stones. Meanwhile, Johnson (Ray Smith), the boss of the Bideawhile Organisation, a hotel chain and leisure conglomerate, is trying to persuade his colleague Mr James (Cyril Luckham) that the methods of a new consultant he has contracted from the Transatlantic Corporation will aid their ability to identify potential employees who may suffer from stress and poor health. Johnson is taken aback when the consultant, Parker (Derek Godfrey), arrives wearing an obviously false nose, but Mr James is unfazed.\nThe man seen earlier, Wilkie (John Neville), arrives for his interview, and is kept waiting on Parker's insistence as a test of his vulnerability. He is interviewed for a management position by Mr James and by Parker\u2014who is now wearing a woman's blonde wig. Wilkie displays extensive knowledge, from the financial and business press, of the company's history and prospects\u2014which he does not think are very promising. He is repeatedly shocked that the firm does not possess a computer. Parker, meanwhile, insists on knowing about Wilkie's relationship with his mother; also about any bedwetting; and pounces on him when he admits to suffering from headaches. Parker concludes (correctly) that Wilkie is recovering from a nervous breakdown.\nAfter Mr James recites a limerick with lines ending on 'Bristol' and 'pistol', Wilkie aims his gun at the two men. Now intent on revenge, he recounts a story about the 'Rary', a (fictional) now-extinct species, and threatens Mr Parker for his insulting fixations. Johnson returns to the office, but flees. He tells the receptionist (Ann Bell) that he should never have taken on Parker. They hear two shots, but Johnson hurriedly leaves. The receptionist discovers that James and Parker are dead, and faints. She comes round at the open window to which Wilkie has moved her. He again tells his 'Rary' story, before jumping to his death from a window of the tall office block.\n\nReputation\nThe recording of \"Shaggy Dog\" was long thought to be lost; its rediscovery was announced in January 2005. The play's director Gareth Davies recalled the work as \"a sad piece about a madman applying for a job. Not a great play. A sort of sour joke.\" Once described as \"perhaps the most bizarre of all Potter's single plays\", it shows Potter continuing with themes begun in The Confidence Game in 1965. \"Shaggy Dog\" has been issued on DVD in Region 2, along with the other plays Potter wrote for LWT.\nPassage 5:\nMartin Ruhe\nMartin Ruhe (born 1965) is a German cinematographer working on films, commercials, and music videos.

Based on the 1990 novel A Very Private Gentleman by Martin Booth, it was loosely adapted to screenplay by Rowan Joff\u00e9. The film was released on September 1, 2010. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $67 million worldwide.\n\nPlot\nJack and his lover, Ingrid, are relaxing in Sweden. As they walk in the wilderness outside their cabin, Jack becomes alarmed by a trail of footprints in the snow and pulls Ingrid towards shelter. Sniper gunshots ring out. Ingrid sees Jack pull a gun from his pocket and shoot the sniper. With little hesitation, Jack also kills Ingrid before locating and killing another armed man. He flees to Rome and contacts a man named Pavel, who insists that Jack cannot stay in Rome. Pavel sends him to Castelvecchio, a small town in the mountains of Abruzzo. Jack becomes nervous, and disposing of the cell phone that Pavel gave him, goes to nearby Castel del Monte instead, where he now uses the name Edward.\nWhile in Abruzzo, Jack contacts Pavel, who sets him up with a job. He meets a woman named Mathilde, who wants him to build her a custom sniper rifle. A local priest named Father Benedetto takes notice of Jack, and befriends him. Jack also begins patronizing a local prostitute named Clara, and they begin a relationship.\nIn the meantime, Jack suspects that he's being followed by a man, but he still meets with Mathilde in a secluded area next to a river to test the weapon. She is impressed by the craftsmanship, but asks Jack to make a few more adjustments to the rifle, and to provide her with specific types of ammunition before they complete their transaction.\nLater, the man who has been following Jack attempts to assassinate him, but Jack kills him after a chase through town. The next day the priest asks Jack if he has anything to confess. Jack has been tormented by dreams of the events in Sweden and regrets killing Ingrid, but shares nothing with the priest. When Father Benedetto tells Jack that he senses he lives in a special kind of hell, \"a place without love\", Jack starts to let himself feel love for Clara and envisions a life with her.\nJack calls Pavel to ask how the Swedes found him, and Pavel tells Jack that he's losing his edge. In his growing fear, he even suspects Clara when he discovers a small pistol in her purse. Jack takes Clara on a picnic to the same secluded river where he tested the rifle with Mathilde, and prepares to kill Clara. But when she doesn't try to kill him, Jack begins to trust Clara and agrees to meet with her later back in town.\nFinally, Jack agrees to deliver the completed weapon and ammunition to Mathilde as his last job, but at the last moment, he re-opens the briefcase holding it. During the drop-off with Mathilde, Jack becomes suspicious that she plans to kill him. But before anything can happen, a bus load of school children arrives. Mathilde gives Jack his payment\u2014a thick envelope full of cash, and the two separate. As Mathilde drives away, Pavel contacts her and asks if she has killed Jack. She tells him she has not, but says she is following him.\nClara then meets Jack at a religious procession in town. Jack asks her to go away with him and she agrees. While they embrace, Mathilde attempts to shoot Jack from a nearby rooftop with the rifle that Jack built. But the rifle backfires in her face, confirming Jack's suspicion and his last-minute decision to sabotage the rifle. Seeing Mathilde fall from the roof, Jack gives Clara the envelope of cash and tells her to wait for him at the river where they had picnicked before. He runs to Mathilde, who is dying on the pavement, and discovers that she also works for Pavel.\nAs Jack walks away to go meet Clara, he hears someone behind him. Jack turns, and they quickly exchange gunfire. Pavel drops dead, having come to finish Mathilde's failed assassination. As Jack drives to meet Clara at the river, he feels his abdomen and realizes he has been shot. Jack arrives at the picnic spot, and as he sees Clara waiting for him, collapses behind the wheel of his car.\n\nCast\nProduction\nFilming began in September 2009 and took place in Castel del Monte, Sulmona, Castelvecchio Calvisio, Calascio and Campo Imperatore in the Province of L'Aquila (Abruzzo); in Rome, and in \u00d6stersund, J\u00e4mtland and other locations. As the Clooney character drives from Rome to Castel del Monte, there is an impressively long drive through the 4600-meter long San Domenico Tunnel (Galleria San Domenico) that is between the exits of Pescina and Cocullo on the A25 highway that connects Rome to Torano and Pescara. The car driven by Jack in the movie is a Fiat Tempra with Pescara licence plates.\nThe film's \"most romantic moment\", according to director Anton Corbijn\u2014when Jack takes Clara to a restaurant of her choice, their \"actual date\"\u2014was filmed at a restaurant in Pacentro, near Sulmona. The comic-acting waiter in this restaurant scene was directed to stand in front of a two-bulb lamp fixture so that he appeared to have \"devil's horns\". Photographs on the restaurant's walls are reportedly all of the lovers of Gabriele D'Annunzio. Clara orders Montepulciano d'Abruzzo wine for the dinner, and Corbijn said the film's company enjoyed many of the fine wines of the region during the months of production there.The film score was written and composed by German singer-songwriter (and longtime friend of Corbijn) Herbert Gr\u00f6nemeyer. A 1967 song called \"Window of My Eyes\" by the Dutch blues band Cuby + Blizzards is played over the ending credits. The aria \"Un bel d\u00ec, vedremo\" (\"One fine day we'll see\") from Puccini's opera Madama Butterfly can be heard in the background of one scene, and \"Tu vu\u00f2 f\u00e0 l'americano\" in another. In another scene, the Italian song \"La bambola\" by Patty Pravo plays.\n\nWestern films and other influences\nOnce Upon a Time in the West (1968), with Henry Fonda facing off as a villain in a gunfight, is playing on television on the back wall of a modest restaurant where Jack has been eating. In the DVD commentary, Corbijn notes this homage and says the American Western\u2014and more specifically the Italian-American Spaghetti Westerns by Leone and others\u2014were explicit models for The American. Corbijn also notes the Ennio Morricone scores made famous in Once Upon a Time in the West, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), and other films. Speaking of the narrow, labyrinthine streets of the Italian hill towns where much of the action of The American occurs, Corbijn says he was thinking, in filming, of the streets of Venice and the way they appeared in Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now (1973).Large segments of the dialogue between Jack and Clara are taken verbatim from Graham Greene's novel The Honorary Consul (1973).\n\nRelease\nMarketing\nThe first official poster was released on June 17, 2010. The first trailer was attached to Robin Hood and the second official trailer on June 19, 2010, and was attached to Jonah Hex, Grown Ups, Inception and The Other Guys.\n\nBox office\nThe American grossed $35.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $32.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total $67.9 million, against a production budget of $20 million.The film debuted to $13.2 million, including a total of $16.7 million over the four-day Labor Day weekend, topping the box office. It fell 57% to $5.7 million in its second weekend, finishing third, and another 53% to $2.7 million in its third weekend.\n\nCritical response\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating 66% based on 224 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's critical consensus states: \"As beautifully shot as it is emotionally restrained, The American is an unusually divisive spy thriller\u2014and one that rests on an unusually subdued performance from George Clooney.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"D\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale. The score was attributed to disappointment after the film was marketed as being action-packed instead of focusing on suspense and drama.Rolling Stone's Peter Travers gave the film two-and-a-half stars, writing that director Anton Corbijn \"holds his film to a steady, often glacial pace\", and that the result is of \"startling austerity\". Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, writing, \"Here is a gripping film with the focus of a Japanese drama, an impenetrable character to equal Alain Delon's in Le Samoura\u00ef, by Jean-Pierre Melville.\" Leonard Maltin called it a \"slowly paced, European-style mood piece, short on dialogue and action and long on atmosphere\".\n\nHome media\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on December 28, 2010.\nPassage 8:\nRobert Baberske\nRobert Baberske (1 May 1900 \u2013 27 March 1958) was a German cinematographer. Although he worked briefly in Britain, Baberske spent most of his career in the German film industry. Baberske began as an assistant to Karl Freund.

He grew up in a musical family of four, a brother and three sisters with most of McCann's family singing in church choirs. His father was a fan of jazz music and his mother was known to hum opera tunes around the house. As a youth, he played the tuba and drums and performed in his school's marching band. As a pianist McCann was largely self-taught. He explained he only received piano lessons for a few weeks as a six-year-old before his teacher died.\n\nCareer\nDuring his service in the U.S. Navy, McCann won a singing contest which led to an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. After leaving the Navy, McCann moved to California and played in his own trio. He declined an offer to work in Cannonball Adderley's band so that he could dedicate himself to his own music. The trio's first job was at the Purple Onion in 1959 accompanying Gene McDaniels.The main part of McCann's career began in the early 1960s when he recorded as a pianist with his trio for Pacific Jazz. In 1969, Atlantic released Swiss Movement, an album recorded with saxophonist Eddie Harris and trumpeter Benny Bailey earlier at that year's Montreux Jazz Festival. The album contained the song \"Compared to What\", and both the album and the single reached the Billboard pop charts. \"Compared to What\" criticized the Vietnam War. The song was written by Eugene McDaniels years earlier and recorded and released as a ballad by McCann in 1966 on his album, Les McCann Plays the Hits. Roberta Flack's version appeared as the opening track on her debut album First Take (1969).\nAfter the success of Swiss Movement, McCann, primarily a piano player emphasized his vocals. He became an innovator in soul jazz merging jazz with funk, soul, and world rhythms. He was among the first jazz musicians to include electric piano, clavinet, and synthesizer in his music.\nIn 1971, he and Harris were part of a group of soul, R&B, and rock performers\u2013including Wilson Pickett, the Staple Singers, Santana, and Ike & Tina Turner\u2013who flew to Accra, Ghana, to perform a 14-hour concert for over 100,000 Ghanaians. The March 6 concert was recorded for the documentary film Soul to Soul. In 2004, the movie was released on DVD with an accompanying soundtrack album.\nMcCann had a stroke in the mid-1990s, but he returned to music in 2002 when Pump it Up was released.

Ginell awarded the album 4 stars, stating, \"As an example of early, unfocused Jarrett, this is fascinating material.\". The authors of the Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings commented: \"Heavily rock-influenced and reminiscent of the methodology of the Charles Lloyd Quartet and the Miles Davis group, of which Jarrett was still a member... it has a freshness of approach that Jarrett quickly lost and was slow to regain.\" Pianist / composer Ethan Iverson singled out \"My Back Pages\" for praise, stating: \"Dylan recorded it as a waltz, but this backbeat 4/4 rendition emulates the hit version by The Byrds.

The album was re-released on two separate CDs in 1991 as Volume 1 and Volume 2.\n\nReception\nThe AllMusic review by Scott Yanow states: \"Shelly Manne & His Men are heard in prime form performing live at their home base, Shelly's Manne-Hole.

It would be later reissued on CD in 1999, with only 13 tracks. The trio performances were recorded at the same sessions that produced At Shelly's Manne-Hole (1963) and were first released on Bill Evans: The Complete Riverside Recordings (1984). The four solo performances (\"Danny Boy\", \"Like Someone in Love\", \"In Your Own Sweet Way\", and \"Easy to Love\") were recorded in a separate session in April 1962 in New York City. \"Some Other Time\" was recorded in December 1958, in New York City.\n\nReception\nThe Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4 stars and states \"This is one of the finest recordings by this particular trio. Worth searching for\".\n\nTrack listing\nThe track listing differs between the original LP and the CD re-issue. This was an attempt to rationalise the Bill Evans catalogue; the LP version was essentially an expanded version of the At Shelly's Manne-Hole album with an additional 8 tracks. The 13 track 1999 CD version removes all the common tracks and adds the solo numbers recorded the month before plus Some Other Time. The CD reissue of At Shelly's Manne-Hole adds All the Things You Are, not featured on either original LP.\n1983 LP Track ListingSide 1:\n\n\"Who Cares?\" (George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin) - 5:22\n\"In a Sentimental Mood\" (Duke Ellington) - 4:23\n\"Everything Happens to Me\" (Tom Adair, Matt Dennis) - 4:46\n\"What Is This Thing Called Love?\" (Cole Porter) - 5:48 *Side 2:\n\n\"Time Remembered\" (Bill Evans) - 5:37\n\"My Heart Stood Still\" (Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart) - 4:33\n\"Lover Man\" (Jimmy Davis, Ram Ramirez, James Sherman) - 5:06 *\n\"Blues in F/Five\" (Chuck Israels/Bill Evans) - 5:41 *Side 3:\n\n\"Love Is Here to Stay\" (George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin) - 4:48 *\n\"'Round Midnight\" (Thelonious Monk, Cootie Williams) - 8:58 *\n\"Stella by Starlight\" (Victor Young, Ned Washington) - 4:59 *\n\"How About You?\" (Ralph Freed, Burton Lane) - 4:04 *Side 4:\n\n\"Isn't It Romantic\" (Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart) - 4:39 *\n\"The Boy Next Door\" (Hugh Martin, Ralph Blane) - 5:24 *\n\"Wonder Why\" (Nicholas Brodzsky, Sammy Cahn) - 5:16\n\"Swedish Pastry\" (Barney Kessel) - 5:48*Indicates selections recorded on May 30, 1963, all others May 31.\n1999 CD Track Listing\n\"Danny Boy\" (Frederick Weatherly) - 10:41\n\"Like Someone in Love\" (Johnny Burke, Jimmy Van Heusen) - 6:27\n\"In Your Own Sweet Way\" (Dave Brubeck) - 2:58\n\"Easy to Love\" (Cole Porter) - 4:42\n\"Some Other Time\" (Leonard Bernstein, Betty Comden, Adolph Green) - 6:12\n\"Lover Man\" (Jimmy Davis, Ram Ramirez, James Sherman) - 5:06\n\"Who Cares?\" (George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin) - 5:24\n\"What Is This Thing Called Love?\" (Cole Porter) - 5:48\n\"How About You?\" (Ralph Freed, Burton Lane) - 4:06\n\"Everything Happens to Me\" (Tom Adair, Matt Dennis) - 4:47\n\"In a Sentimental Mood\" (Duke Ellington, Manny Kurtz, Irving Mills) - 4:26\n\"My Heart Stood Still\" (Lorenz Hart, Richard Rodgers) - 4:34\n\"Time Remembered\" (Bill Evans) - 5:35\n\nPersonnel\nBill Evans - piano\nChuck Israels - bass\nLarry Bunker - drums\nPassage 8:\nLive at Shelly's Manne-Hole\nLive at Shelly's Manne-Hole is an album by pianist Les McCann recorded on New Year's Eve 1965 at Shelly's Manne-Hole and released on the Limelight label.\n\nReception\nAllmusic gives the album 4 stars stating \"This album is one of the best from this artist's early acoustic days\".\n\nTrack listing\nAll compositions by Les McCann except as indicated\n\n\"She Broke My Heart (And I Broke Her Jaw)\" - 4:23\n\"I'll Be On Home\" - 5:00\n\"All Alone\" (Irving Berlin) - 4:04\n\"My Friends\" - 5:15\n\"I Could Have Danced All Night\" (From My Fair Lady) (Frederick Loewe, Alan Jay Lerner) -  \t3:32\n\"That Was the Freak That Was\" - 5:35\n\"Young and Foolish\" (From Plain and Fancy) (Albert Hague, Arnold B.

The trio featured Chuck Israels, who followed Scott LaFaro on bass in autumn 1961, and Larry Bunker on drums, who just joined the reformed trio, after Paul Motian had left. An additional eight performances recorded during the trio's May, 1963 engagement at Shelly's Manne-Hole were released on the album Time Remembered.\n\nReception\nWriting for Allmusic, music critic Daniel Gioffre wrote of the album: \"This particular trio may lack some of the sheer combustive force of the better-known lineup, but it is, if possible, even more sensitive, melancholic, and nostalgic than the previous band... Jazz is rarely as sensitive or as melodic as this.

As a result, Cannonball's recordings would become more commercial as the 1960s developed but this early Capitol effort is quite good.

Andrews attended Hitherfield Primary School in South-East London before moving with his family to Park North, Swindon, at the age of seven. He attended Park North Junior School, Richard Jefferies Secondary School and Park Senior High School, leaving full-time education in 1976.\n\nCareer\nOn leaving school, Andrews played keyboards in covers bands in Swindon and Exeter before joining XTC in 1978. He played on the band\u2019s first two albums, White Music and Go 2, before leaving in 1979. That same year, he recorded the solo EP Town and Country (Virgin) and played on Iggy Pop\u2019s Soldier (Arista) with David Bowie, Ivan Kr\u00e1l, Glen Matlock, Klaus Kr\u00fcger and Steve New.\nIn 1980 he recorded the single Rossmore Road/Win a Night Out with a Well-Known Paranoiac on Virgin. Also in 1980, Andrews joined Robert Fripp's The League of Gentlemen with Sara Lee and Jonny TooBad. They recorded one album for E.G. Records before Fripp dismissed the band. Andrews then formed Restaurant for Dogs with Kevin Wilkinson, Dave Marx and Bruce McRae. Latterly Clare Hirst, Sara Lee and Carlo Asciutti joined the band.\n\nIn 1981, Andrews met up with bassist Dave Allen who had recently left Gang of Four and the pair, along with guitarist/vocalist Carl Marsh, formed Shriekback. Shriekback have been active for 41 years, recording 17 studio albums. \n\nIn 2003, Andrews began releasing solo projects through his own Shriekprods label. These form two main strands: the Haunted Box of Switches series of piano and voice albums which feature original material alongside minimalist reimaginings of Shriekback songs; and the Stic Basin series of albums of experimental electronica, of which there are now three volumes.\nIn 2005, Andrews played keyboards on Brian Eno\u2019s album Another Day on Earth. 2007 saw Andrews reunite with former XTC bandmate Andy Partridge alongside Shriekback drummer Martyn Barker on Monstrance, a double album of instrumental improvisations. In 2015, Andrews recorded a six-track EP called Juju Grid with Mike Tournier from Fluke, under the name of Anaxaton6. Contaminated Pop in 2019 was Andrews\u2019 first solo album released under his own name.\nDuring a six-year hiatus from music from 1996 to 2001, Andrews began to design furniture and sculpture and studied for a degree in 3D Design in Metals at Camberwell and Middlesex universities. He also ran The Hoxton Gift Shop with R\u00e9gine de la Hey in 2001, a gallery which sold original artworks.\n\nPersonal life\nAndrews lives in London and Stroud, Gloucestershire. He has a son, Finn Andrews, the lead singer/songwriter of The Veils, from his marriage to Vivienne Kent in the early 1980s.\n\nDiscography\nPassage 2:\nHopp\u00edpolla\n\"Hopp\u00edpolla\" (pronounced [\u02c8h\u0254\u02b0pi\u02ccp\u02b0\u0254tl\u0325a]) is a song by Icelandic post-rock band Sigur R\u00f3s from their 2005 album Takk.... It was released as the album's second single on 28 November 2005. The song title is a univerbation of hoppa \u00ed polla (the -a in hoppa is not pronounced), which is Icelandic for \"hopping into puddles\", and the lyrics are mainly in Icelandic, with some nonsensical phrases, a \"language\" the band calls Vonlenska (\"Hopelandic\"). As with many of the band's songs, it was given a nickname in the early stages of writing. \"Hopp\u00edpolla\" was \"The Money Song\", as the band was certain they had written a song which would have commercial success.\"Hopp\u00edpolla\" is the band's most successful single, charting at number 24 on the UK Singles Chart in May 2006. It is also considered the best-known song within its genre. The single also features \"Me\u00f0 bl\u00f3\u00f0nasir\", an instrumental coda to \"Hopp\u00edpolla\", which is also featured on Takk...; and a studio remake of \"Hafss\u00f3l\", a song previously released on the band's 1997 debut album, Von. The title appears as \"Hafs\u00f3l\" on the single.\n\nTrack listings\nCD (CDEM 673) / 12-inch (12EM 673)\n\n\"Hopp\u00edpolla\" \u2013 4:36\n\"Me\u00f0 bl\u00f3\u00f0nasir\" \u2013 2:24\n\"Hafs\u00f3l\" (2005 version) \u2013 9:477-inch (EM 673)\n\n\"Hopp\u00edpolla\" \u2013 4:36\n\"Heys\u00e1tan\" \u2013 4:09\n\nMusic video\nA promotional music video for \"Hopp\u00edpolla,\" directed by Arni & Kinski, was filmed in November 2005. It depicts two groups of elderly friends strolling around the suburbs of Reykjav\u00edk and acting like children; pulling pranks on people and battling with water balloons and wooden swords near a cemetery. When one old man is injured and suffers a nosebleed (as referenced in the lyrics), the opponents run away in fear, while the others celebrate their victory. The video shows several shots of the friends \"hopping in puddles\" of water along a path.\nThe band members are featured in the video: keyboardist Kjartan Sveinsson plays the victim of a Knock, Knock, Ginger trick, guitarist and vocalist J\u00f3n \u00de\u00f3r Birgisson plays the cashier at a shop where an old man steals and eats some pears, drummer Orri P\u00e1ll D\u00fdrason can be seen repairing his bicycle, and bassist Georg H\u00f3lm can be seen cleaning.\n\nCharts\nCertifications\nChicane cover version \u2013 \"Poppiholla\"\nIn July 2009, Chicane released an instrumental re-work of the song, titled \"Poppiholla\" and released it as a five track single EP on 13 July 2009. \"Poppiholla\" entered the UK Singles Chart at number seven on 19 July 2009, spending three weeks in the top ten as of 2 August 2009. A video to promote the song was made, and Chicane's The Best of Chicane collection was re-released to include the song. The re-released album reached number 11 on the UK Albums Chart, beating the compilation's previous peak of number 16 (without \"Poppiholla\" on it). The song was used in the UK by Sky Sports for their coverage of the Guinness Premiership in 2009\u201310.\n\nCharts\nWeekly charts\nYear-end charts\nRelease history\nUse in film and television\n\"Hopp\u00edpolla\" was used in 2006 advertisements for the BBC's Planet Earth television series, giving the band exposure to a mainstream audience. A high demand for the single led to it being republished in May 2006, distributed by EMI. This re-release of the single brought critical acclaim for the band in the mainstream music media. It was used again in 2016 for Planet Earth II, as well as Blue Planet II the following year.\nThe song has been used as background music in BBC shows, including dramas, documentaries and its 2006 football coverage. It appeared in the trailers for the films Children of Men and Slumdog Millionaire, the soundtrack of the 2006 film Penelope, the 2011 film We Bought a Zoo, and the 2021 film The Mitchells vs. the Machines, the latter of which was composed by J\u00f3nsi and has been used in advertisements for Thomson Reuters, Oxfam and Viasat. The song has also been used in the film of Italian capital Rome's bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics. While it does not appear on the film's soundtrack album, it is also featured in Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga.\nPassage 3:\nLike Light to the Flies\n\"Like Light to the Flies\" (or \"Like Light\", as it is often referred to) is a song by American heavy metal band Trivium and is the first single and music video from their 2005 album, Ascendancy. The band originally considered using the song \"Ember to Inferno\" as their first single but changed their minds after recording this song (along with \"Blinding Tears Will Break the Skies\" and \"The Deceived\"). \"Like Light\" was released in January 2005 and features a mix of screaming and singing. The song contains two guitar solos which are played nearly consecutively to sound as one longer solo; a small interlude is played in the middle of them.

It is the current entrance theme used by Cena in WWE. Cena recorded the song in 2005 for his debut studio album, You Can't See Me. The song was released on March 17, 2005, as the lead single from the album on Columbia and WWE Music Group. The song was released as a single on the iTunes Store on June 20, 2011.The song is widely known as being part of the Internet meme \"Unexpected John Cena\".\n\nBackground\nCena made his television debut answering an open challenge by Kurt Angle on June 27, 2002. In October, Cena and Billy Kidman took part in a tag team tournament to crown the first WWE Tag Team Champions of the SmackDown! brand, losing in the first round. The next week, Cena turned on and attacked Kidman, blaming him for their loss, becoming a villain. Shortly after the Kidman attack, on a Halloween themed episode of SmackDown, Cena dressed as Vanilla Ice performing a freestyle rap. The next week, Cena received a new character: a rapper who cuts promos while rhyming.He performed his own theme song, \"Basic Thugonomics\", and it was featured on the WWE soundtrack album WWE Originals. He also recorded a song, \"Untouchables\", for the company's next soundtrack album WWE ThemeAddict: The Music, Vol. 6. He collaborated on the song H-U-S-T-L-E remix along with Murs, E-40, and Chingo Bling. Cena's debut album, You Can't See Me, was recorded with his cousin Tha Trademarc.\n\nComposition\n\"The Time Is Now\" was composed by Cena along with his cousin, Marc Predka (better known by his stage name Tha Trademarc). Having recorded the album with Cena, Predka was featured on virtually every track of the album. Production was handled by Jake One. The song contains samples of \"Ante Up\" by M.O.P. which in turn samples \"Soul Sister, Brown Sugar\" by Sam & Dave, and Pete Schofield and The Canadians' rendition of \"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia\" originally by Vicki Lawrence.On October 14, 2008, M.O.P. filed suit in a New York Federal Court against Sony BMG, Stephanie Music Publishing, Cherry Lane Music Publishing Company, WWE and John Cena. The group alleged that Cena and the WWE stole parts of their song \"Ante Up\" for his theme song, arguing that the song was unlawfully sampled and clearly repeated three times, during the introduction, the second and third chorus. M.O.P. sought the destruction of the song and $150,000 in damages. They dropped the lawsuit two months later.\n\nUsage in video games\nThe song was used in the video games WWE Day of Reckoning 2, Scooby Doo: WrestleMania, SmackDown! vs RAW 2006, SmackDown vs RAW 2007, SmackDown vs RAW 2008, SmackDown vs RAW 2009, SmackDown vs RAW 2010, SmackDown vs RAW 2011, WWE All Stars, WWE '12, WWE '13, WWE 2K14, WWE 2K15, WWE 2K16, WWE 2K17,  WWE 2K18, WWE 2K19,WWE 2K20, WWE 2K Battlegrounds, WWE 2K22, and WWE 2K23.\nPassage 8:\nFresh Azimiz\n\"Fresh Azimiz\" (\"fresh as I'm is\") is a single featured on rapper Bow Wow's 2005 album Wanted. It is the third song after his singles \"Let Me Hold You\" with singer Omarion and \"Like You\" with Ciara. It features J-Kwon & Jermaine Dupri. The song was produced by Jermaine Dupri. The song became his third Top 40 single from his 2005 album Wanted, peaking at number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100.\nAlthough released through Columbia Records, the lyrics on the 2nd verse of the original song explains that Bow Wow still has close ties to So So Def Recordings (\"Records say Columbia, but I'm So So man\").\n\nRumored diss to Romeo\nRumors circulated that the song was meant to attack rapper Lil' Romeo, with the line, \"18 nigga, making more than your Dad.\" The line in question is actually borrowed from LL Cool J's song, \"The Do Wop\" on the classic album Bigger and Deffer. Bow Wow later confirmed that the line was not aimed at Miller's father,  Master P or  Miller himself. Because of that, Romeo dedicated the song of God's Gift entitled \"U Can't Shine Like Me\" with the line \"You a Mama's boy I'm a son of a hustler\".\n\nLive performance\nOn April 1, 2006, Bow Wow performed \"Fresh Azimiz\" at the 2006 Kids' Choice Awards as part of a musical duel with singer Chris Brown that was inspired by the 1986 Run-D.M.C. music video \"Walk This Way\".\n\nRemix\nA remix of this song features rapper Mike Jones, replacing Bow Wow's 2nd verse. There is a video for the remix, with additional scenes with Bow Wow & Jones throughout the video and Bow Wow's verse removed and Mike Jones' instead comes in and raps. Jones also makes an appearance on the original version's video.\n\nCharts\nWeekly charts\nYear-end charts\nPassage 9:\nSpiritual Unity (Marc Ribot album)\nSpiritual Unity is a 2005 album by guitarist Marc Ribot released on Pi Recordings.

The house was commissioned by Gerald B. Tonkens (an automobile dealer) and his first wife Rosalie. It is located in Amberley Village, a village in Hamilton County, Ohio.\nWright designed the home in the Usonian Automatic style. It is considered one of the finest and most intact examples of Usonian Automatic architecture ever produced and was designated a National Historic Landmark and listed in the National Register of Historic Places on October 3, 1991.\n\nDescription\nThe Tonkens House is a single story, three bedroom, two bathroom private residence, designed in the Usonian Automatic style. The house is situated on a partially developed 3.54-acre property in Amberley Village, Ohio and measures some 2,100 square feet. An early 20th-century guest cottage also occupies the property, a remnant of its earlier use as a farm.\nThe Usonian Automatic style was Frank Lloyd Wright's final architectural period and is based on a modular design system that employed interlocking, precast concrete blocks. It was first conceived by Wright in the wake of the Depression in 1936 and later developed as a response to a lack of low-cost housing and rising construction costs following World War Two.\nLike many of Wright's Usonian style buildings, the floor plan of the Tonkens House mimics the shape of a polliwog. The tail of the polliwog is represented by the bedroom wing, with each room opening off into a long, narrow hallway. The hallway leads into 'the body' of the house, which consists of a bright and expansive living room or Great Room, alongside a kitchen and foyer. The configuration allowed for additional rooms to be added to the bedroom wing if required. The Great Room was designed as a large, warm and welcoming space, a room in which the family and their guests could gather throughout the day and night.\nThe master bedroom contains an en-suite and private study, which opens off to a private patio. Ceilings in the bedroom wing are low (7.5 feet) and gilded in 18 karat gold leaf. On the other hand, those in the Great Room, kitchen and foyer are high (10.5 feet and 13.5 feet respectively) and unembellished. The Great Room contains a cantilevered fireplace and east-facing wall of floor-to-ceiling windows and French doors that open onto a lanai at the rear of the house. Philippine mahogany was used for interior paneling and furniture. Piano hinges (hinges extending from the top to the bottom of a door) were used for all doors in the house, including closet doors.The house was constructed using eleven styles of precast concrete blocks, reinforced by steel rods. It has a total of 492 windows, which consist of glass contained within the precast concrete blocks. Instead of gutters, copper flashing and downspouts allow for water to run off the roof, which is protected by insulation, a rubber membrane and pea gravel.Two Wright designed gates guard a Cherokee red concrete driveway leading towards the house. The dwelling has no garage or basement, keeping with Wright's well known dislike for such spaces. Instead, two carports\u2014divided by concrete and glass pillars\u2014and two storage sheds occupy the property.\n\nHistory\nGerald B. Tonkens was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1919 where he was exposed to many examples of Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s architecture from a young age. This had a lasting effect on Tonkens, who later stated \u201cI always admired Mr Wright\u2019s work. I always knew that I would never build a house on my own unless it was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright\u201d.After graduating from the University of Wisconsin in the early 1940s, Tonkens joined the U.S military, fighting with the Eighth Air Force during World War Two. Tonkens met and married his first wife, Red Cross nurse, Rosalie Robbins, while stationed with the military in Europe.By 1953 the couple had two daughters and decided to move to Hamilton County, where Gerald established the 'Tonkens Oldsmobile-Cadillac' dealership in Hamilton, Ohio. In 1954 Gerald and Rosalie purchased a 2.75 acre block in Amberley Village, Ohio for $6,000. The land was cheap in comparison to surrounding lots, many of which sold for an average price of $25,000 per acre. When Rosalie queried the price, she was told that the property was considered a \u201cproblem lot\u201d as no architect had been able to engineer a driveway up the steep incline from the road to the house. When this was raised with Wright, he replied \"They built the Suez Canal, didn't they? We'll go right up the middle with a big shovel\".Once the purchase was finalized, the couple who were on a tight budget, yet still wanted a Frank Lloyd Wright-esque home, approached a local architect who had studied under Wright in the 1930s. Although early meetings were successful, Gerald and Rosalie were ultimately unhappy with the architect's design and cancelled their agreement in early 1954. After some discussion, they decided to contact Wright himself with a proposal for the house and a budget of $25,000.  Shortly thereafter, Wright invited them to Taliesin in Spring Green, Wisconsin to discuss the design. Their meeting was a success and the first half of 1954 was spent discussing designs via letter and telegram between the Tonkens and Wright's personal assistant Eugene Beyer \"Gene\" Masselink. In mid-1954 Wright asked if the couple would be interested in being his \u2018guinea pigs\u2019 stating his desire to design their home as \u201can experiment in Usonian Automatic architecture\u201d. They agreed, and Wright's preliminary designs for the home were completed in October of the same year.\nDrawings for the Tonkens House were completed by Frank Lloyd Wright, his grandson and apprentice, Eric Lloyd Wright, and John H. \"Jack\" Howe. John deKoven Hill and Cornelia Brierly were landscape designers on the project. Engineering drawings were completed by William Wesley Peters, Edmond Thomas \"Tom\" Casey and Mendel Glickman. Glickman was also solely responsible for the ceiling block engineering.  Furniture, upholstery and fabric selections for the house were supervised by John deKoven Hill. Final drawings and specifications were presented to Gerald and Rosalie on February 25, 1955, and approved soon after. The 'Tonkens House' would be assigned project number 5510 by the Taliesin Foundation.The final design featured three bedrooms, one study, two bathrooms, Philippine mahogany paneling throughout, a grand living room (the Great Room) with a cantilevered fireplace, two carports and two storage sheds. A comprehensive furniture plan included built-in pieces as well as Frank Lloyd Wright designed furniture from his collection for Henredon Furniture, and Wright designed upholstery.\nThe house remained in the Tonkens family for over six decades, until it was sold to a private buyer in 2015.\n\nConstruction\nThe Tonkens hired local contractor, Horace Wersel, to be the project lead and Cincinnati firm Harvard Construction Co. to build the house. The construction of the Tonkens House was overseen by the Taliesin Fellowship, which was represented by Eric Lloyd Wright. Wright spent over a year living in Cincinnati while overseeing the construction of the home. Such close supervision was unusual, and the Tonkens House was the first Usonian Automatic structure to be solely directed by a Taliesin fellow.\nThe home incorporated Wright's iconic precast concrete blocks. These were made using metal molds into which concrete was poured and then set. The Tonkens house is built using eleven block variations, which allowed for infinite modifications to the design. Masonry subcontractors were used to lay the foundation, while carpentry subcontractors were used to lay the blocks. Blocks were two feet wide by one foot high for walls, and two feet high by two feet wide for ceilings. Blocks were adhered to a reinforced concrete slab, unlike Wright's Californian homes, in which ceiling blocks were adhered to wooden slabs. Concrete blocks for the Tonkens House were made as a lightweight cinder block. Because cinder blocks are porous, a sand based sealer was applied to the exterior of the building to waterproof the house.\n\nBy mid-1955 the total cost of construction, including Wright's 10 percent fee and additional costs for interior furnishings, was up to $59,000. The increase was due in part to rising values of materials such as steel, concrete and wood.  Complications associated with casting concrete blocks also raised construction costs. Expenditure continued to increase throughout the duration of the construction and Cindy Damschroder estimates that the final cost of construction was likely to have been around $118,000.\nThe Tonkens House was completed in late-July 1956. Frank Lloyd Wright died in 1959. Prior to his death he was in the midst of designing the Beth Sholom Congregation in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, as well as a number of residential homes. Therefore, he would never see the completed Tonkens House. He did however meet with the Tonkens soon after it was completed, presenting them with a hand signed, Cherokee red glazed tile to attest his approval of the home. The tile was permanently placed on the exterior wall, just outside the front entrance.\n\nVariations in design\nOver the eighteen month construction period, a number of minor changes were made to the original design. These included modifying the driveway, installing additional electrical outlets to the exterior of the house and increasing the size of the master bedroom.  A pool was included in initial designs and registered by Taliesin. In late 1955, Eric Lloyd Wright proposed that the pool be relocated as it was positioned above solid ground, with only earth fill below.  Although the pool was relocated and re-sized, it was never built. A cabana and covered porch were also envisioned for the home, but these did not make it onto the final designs.\n\nRepair and restoration\nIn July 2001, renovations were undertaken to restore and upgrade the home's aging roof, original plumbing, wiring and kitchen. During this time, a heavy rainstorm hit the Greater Cincinnati area. In addition to flooding more than 70 homes and killing three people, strong winds blew protective tarp off the roof, exposing it to the heavy downpour. The Philippine mahogany walls and cabinetry in the living room, dining room and kitchen all suffered significant water damage, as did the home's precast concrete block ceiling. These elements required replacement, a project that took almost a year to complete. Care was taken to ensure the renovations were sympathetic to the original design and character of the home and it continues to be the only largely unaltered Frank Lloyd Wright house in the Greater Cincinnati area.In mid-2015, the new roof was found to have failed. Additional repairs are currently underway, a complex task due to the unique design of the structure.\n\nSee also\nList of Frank Lloyd Wright works\n\nNotes\nStorrer, William Allin.

Bulbulian Residence is a house located at 1229 Skyline Drive, Rochester, Minnesota, United States.  Designed by noted architect Frank Lloyd Wright it was completed in 1947 for Arthur H. Bulbulian, a pioneer in the field of facial prosthetics. It is down the street from the Thomas Keys House and not far from the James McBean Residence, all three examples of Wright's Usonian genre of architecture. The Bulbulian Residence is a one-story house built with one 120-degree angle, and is constructed of cement brick and cypress. The house has recently been restored to near-original condition.\n\nSee also\nList of Frank Lloyd Wright works\nPassage 4:\nTheodore A. Pappas House\nThe Theodore A. Pappas House is a Frank Lloyd Wright designed Usonian house in St. Louis, Missouri. The Pappas house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, when it was only 15 years old. It is one of two houses in St. Louis designed by Wright, and the only Usonian Automatic in Missouri. Wright designed it between 1955 and 1959 at the Pappas\u2019 request, and Theodore and Bette Pappas built the house together with the help of day laborers between 1960 and 1964. The Pappas house is a rambling four-bedroom house, and after the Gerald B. and Beverley Tonkens House, is the largest of the Usonian Automatics built.\nThe entire body of the Pappas House, including the roof, is made up of plain concrete blocks standardized to a module. These blocks were placed on top of and next to one another with no mortar. The hidden sides of each block had hollows through which steel rods were inserted, running vertically and horizontally, creating a \"knit\" effect. Grout was used to fill the hollows after the rods were in place. Theoretically, all elements of the house could be manufactured and sent to the owners as a sort of \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d kit, the \u201cautomatic\u201d aspect of an Usonian Automatic. However, metal molds for the blocks were not available, and the blocks had to be cast in molds created by a local craftsman. The concrete was pretinted according to Wright's idea that color should be in and not on the surface. The color scheme throughout the house is monochromatic, a warm natural, earthen color, complemented by a uniform unstained Philippine mahogany for trim and built in furniture. (Storrer, 422)\nIn 1985, Bette Pappas wrote a book titled \"No Passing Fancy\" (ASIN B000IZVEES) about her house. Bette Pappas died at the home in February 2018 at the age of 91.In 2020, the house was sold by the Pappas children to the Frank Lloyd Wright Revival Initiative, a non-profit created by filmmaker Michael Miner.  It is anticipated the house will be refurbished and turned into a museum and event center. In May 2021, the house was opened for public tours by appointment.\n\nSee also\nList of Frank Lloyd Wright works\nPassage 5:\nRobert H. Sunday House\nThe Robert H. Sunday House is located in Marshalltown, Iowa, United States.  It was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in the Usonian style, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.  Initially the Sunday's choose the Usonian Automatic, a natural concrete block model, for their home.  When it provided unworkable, Wright sent the plans for this house. In style and materials it is very similar to the 1953 Usonian Exhibition House.  It was the sixth of seven houses designed by Wright and built in this style in Iowa.  Sunday, who owned Marshall Lumber in Marshalltown, acted as his own general contractor.  In fact, he and his wife did much of the work themselves.  It is also believed to be last of this style built in brick.  John H. \"Jack\" Howe, a Wright assistant who supervised the initial construction, designed an addition to this house in 1970 that conforms seamlessly with the original.  It includes the family room, family room terrace, and the dining room.  The original house followed an \"L\" shaped plan, and with the addition it is now a \"T\" shaped plan.  Howe had previously designed (1964) the building for Sunday's business.\n\nSee also\nList of Frank Lloyd Wright works\nPassage 6:\nGildersleeve House\nThe Gildersleeve House was a house located at 108 Broadway in Hudson, Illinois. Settler James T. Gildersleeve built the Greek Revival house for his family in 1836. Gildersleeve founded the village of Hudson and named it after the area of New York where he formerly lived. The house was the village's first frame house and was its finest home in its early years; as a result, it hosted local events and was the village's first post office. Gildersleeve planted five oak trees outside the house; the trees grew together at their base, giving the house the name \"Five Oaks\". The house was demolished in 2000.The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 28, 1977, and was delisted in 2020.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 7:\nHause House\nThe Hause House project was one of the many un-built works designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1939.  This building structure was one of his Usonian designs that was a short-tailed rectangular plan to be located in Lansing, Michigan.  Although the structure was never built, it was developed into working drawings and was utilized in the creation of another Frank Lloyd Wright design for the Florida Southern College Faculty House.  The Hause House was a Usonian based on the design of wood board and batten exterior as many of them are, while the Florida Southern College Faculty House was a concrete structure.  Many similarities are seen on each floor plan with only minor changes due to the Hause projects site location.\nPassage 8:\nPaul J. and Ida Trier House\nThe Paul J. and Ida Trier House is a historic building located in Johnston, Iowa, United States. It is a Frank Lloyd Wright designed Usonian home that was constructed in 1958.  It was the last of seven Wright Usonians built in Iowa.  While it is now located in a residential area, it was constructed in an area surrounded by rural farmland.  The Trier house is a variation on the 1953 Exhibition House at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York.  The north wing of the house was designed by Taliesin Associates and built in 1967.  It was originally the carport, which was enclosed for a playroom.  The present carport on the front and an extension of the shop was added at the same time.\nThe exterior of the house is composed of hollow clay tile blocks, while the addition is brick matching the tiles.  A low, flat roof caps the home.  The interior features red concrete slab floors, with the exception of the kitchen where they are slate.  Philippine mahogany is used for the woodwork.  A large fireplace is located in the living room.  The living room, kitchen, and bedrooms all face south with window walls in the living room and master bedroom.  A deep overhang shades the rooms in the summer.  The other bedrooms and the study have a band of windows.  Typical of a Wright-designed home, the house is integrated into the site and opened to the outdoors.\n\nSee also\nList of Frank Lloyd Wright works\nPassage 9:\nRitcher House\nThe Ritcher House is considered to be one of the best examples of Frank Lloyd Wright's Usonian mode of design in North Carolina. Located near downtown Raleigh, the house is one of many Modernist houses that were built in the city during the mid-20th century. Most of these homes were designed by faculty members of the North Carolina State University School of Design. Established in 1948 by Henry Kamphoefner, the school hired several Modernist architects as faculty members. Kamphoefner was awarded the North Carolina Award for Fine Arts in 1978 for his work and for his encouragement of other Modernists to build and design homes in the state. On September 21, 1994, the Ritcher House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The house is also a Raleigh Historic Landmark.George Matsumoto, a professor teaching architectural classes at North Carolina State University, designed the Ritcher House in 1951 along with Henry Kamphoefner. The house was built on a modest budget and is an example of modular constructivism and timber framing.\n\nSee also\nList of Registered Historic Places in North Carolina\nPassage 10:\nZimmerman House (Manchester, New Hampshire)\nThe Zimmerman House is a house museum in the North End neighborhood of Manchester, New Hampshire. Built in 1951, it is the first of two houses in New Hampshire designed by Frank Lloyd Wright (the other is the Toufic H. Kalil House, built in 1955 on the same street), and one of a modest number of Wright designs in the northeastern United States. The house was built for Dr. Isadore Zimmerman and his wife Lucille. The house is now owned by the Currier Museum of Art because of the Zimmermans' decision to donate the home to the public after their death. The museum provides tours of the building, which is the only legal access to the grounds. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\n\nDescription and history\nThe Zimmerman House is located in a residential setting in northern Manchester, New Hampshire. It is a single-story structure, set on a floating concrete slab. It is organized around a large L-shaped central chimney, and covered by a deeply overhanging roof. The rooms are arranged in a single line, except with an open carport at one end. The interior is largely finished in cypress wood.\nThe house was designed in 1950 by Frank Lloyd Wright in his Usonian style for Dr. Isadore and Lucille Zimmerman. It has two bedrooms, is based on a four-foot module, and is constructed of red glazed brick with Georgia cypress trim (less expensive than tidewater cypress). John Geiger, then an apprentice in Wright's Taliesin Fellowship, was sent to New Hampshire to supervise the construction of the Zimmerman house. He was responsible for the completion of the project and much of its final changes for the clients. Wright redesigned the house around a rock just outside the front entrance. Wright's design extended to include the interior furniture and furnishings. This includes a musical quartet stand, as well as the mailbox. Wright also specified the plantings for the garden.The property was maintained by the Zimmermans according to Wright's plan, and was donated to the Currier Museum of Art in 1988. The museum offers tours of the property with shuttle service to the house, in order to minimize traffic in the residential neighborhood. No other access to the property is permitted.\n\nSee also\nList of Frank Lloyd Wright works\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire", "answers": ["Amberley Village"], "incorrect_answer": "Libertyville"}, {"input": "Who designed the hotel that held the IFBB professional bodybuilding competition in September 1991?", "context": "Passage 1:\n1981 Ms. Olympia\nThe 1981 Ms. Olympia contest was an IFBB professional bodybuilding competition was held on August 22, 1981, at the Sheraton Hotel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

It is the sister resort of the Walt Disney World Swan. Both hotels were designed by Michael Graves. The Dolphin opened on June 4, 1990, as part of a joint venture between the Walt Disney Company, Tishman Hotel Corporation, MetLife and Starwood Hotels and Resorts, which was merged into Marriott International in 2019. The land the resort occupies is owned by the Walt Disney Company, while the buildings themselves are leased by Disney to the Tishman Hotel Corporation and MetLife but operated by Marriott International under the Sheraton Hotels and Resorts brand. The Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin are a part of the Walt Disney Collection of resorts; because of this they are Disney branded and guests of the resort have access to special Disney benefits available to Disney Resort Hotel guests only.\n\nThe Dolphin and Swan share similar elements, but each has a distinctive appearance. The Dolphin is composed of a 257-foot (78 m) tall triangular tower bisecting a 12-story rectangular mass with four 9-story wings on the Swan-side of the structure. The roof of each half of the main mass is adorned with a 56-foot (17 m) tall Dolphin statue. On the main colored facade there is a turquoise banana-leaf pattern echoed by a similar wave pattern on the Swan.\n The statues on top of the Dolphin hotel are not mammalian dolphins, but a stylized version of a nautical dolphin, a common symbol used on old world nautical maps. The design of the creatures is based on Triton Fountain in Rome.\nIn 2008, The Walt Disney Dolphin Resort was awarded a One Palm Designation through the Florida Green Lodging Program, established by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.\n\nDining\nFine dining\nTodd English's BlueZoo - Seafood\nShula's Steak House - Steak and Seafood\n\nCasual dining\nCabana Bar and Beach Club - Poolside\nThe Fountain - Food and Ice Cream Shop\n\nQuick service\nFuel - Snacks and Treats\nPicabu - Cafeteria Style Restaurant\n\nLounges\nShula's Lounge\nTodd English's Bluezoo Lounge\nPhins\n\nHistory\nIn the late 1980s, Disney saw that they were losing business to area hotels that catered to conventions and large meetings, so Michael Eisner decided to build a convention-oriented hotel near Epcot. The Tishman Group, the contractor who was hired to build Epcot and who also had hotels in the nearby Disney hotel zone, claimed that the Epcot deal gave them exclusive rights to operate convention hotels on the Disney property, so Disney partnered with Tishman to develop the Swan and Dolphin complex. The Swan was managed by Westin Hotels & Resorts, and the Dolphin by Sheraton Hotels & Resorts. Eisner had used Graves for other company projects and wanted to continue to build striking, unique buildings.Tishman and MetLife own the buildings, but have a 99-year lease on the land from Disney. Disney also receives a share of the hotel's revenues, and has a say in any design or architecture changes to the interior or exterior of the buildings.\n\nWalt Disney World privileges\nWalt Disney World Swan and Dolphin guests are provided complimentary transportation to all Walt Disney World theme parks and attractions on the Disney Transportation System, via boat (to Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studios). Length-of-stay park passes are available, as is package delivery from Disney theme park shops to the resort. There is a Walt Disney World guest services desk located in the lobby of each resort. Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin guests can also use Extra Magic Hours, and can make dining reservations 60 days prior to their arrival at the resort. However, room charging (using hotel key as a credit card at Walt Disney World) is not available and hotel restaurants only participate in the Tables in Wonderland Dining Plan, not the Disney Dining Plan. Room charging within the Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin Resort Complex is available. Also, guests staying at the Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin have free theme park parking and priority access to the Disney theme parks during sell out situations.\nPassage 3:\n2012 Ms. Olympia\nThe 2012 Ms. Olympia contest was an IFBB professional bodybuilding competition and part of Joe Weider's Olympia Fitness & Performance Weekend 2012 was held on September 28, 2012, at the South Hall in the Las Vegas Convention Center in Winchester, Nevada and in the Orleans Arena at The Orleans Hotel and Casino in Paradise, Nevada.

In the European Union it has been designated as a 'priority species' under Annex II of the Habitats Directive since 1992, which means areas in which it occurs can be declared Special Areas of Conservation, if these areas belong to one of the number of habitats listed in Annex I of the directive.\nPassage 2:\nTricholoma apium\nTricholoma apium is a mushroom of the agaric genus Tricholoma that is found in Europe. It is classified as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\n\nSee also\nList of North American Tricholoma\nList of Tricholoma species\nPassage 3:\nApiaceae\nApiaceae () or Umbelliferae is a family of mostly aromatic flowering plants named after the type genus Apium and commonly known as the celery, carrot or parsley family, or simply as umbellifers. It is the 16th-largest family of flowering plants, with more than 3,800 species in about 446 genera, including such well-known and economically important plants as ajwain, angelica, anise, asafoetida, caraway, carrot, celery, chervil, coriander, cumin, dill, fennel, lovage, cow parsley, parsley, parsnip and sea holly, as well as silphium, a plant whose identity is unclear and which may be extinct.The family Apiaceae includes a significant number of phototoxic species, such as giant hogweed, and a smaller number of highly poisonous species, such as poison hemlock, water hemlock, spotted cowbane, fool's parsley, and various species of water dropwort.\n\nDescription\nMost Apiaceae are annual, biennial or perennial herbs (frequently with the leaves aggregated toward the base), though a minority are woody shrubs or small trees such as Bupleurum fruticosum.:\u200a35\u200a Their leaves are of variable size and alternately arranged, or with the upper leaves becoming nearly opposite. The leaves may be petiolate or sessile. There are no stipules but the petioles are frequently sheathing and the leaves may be perfoliate. The leaf blade is usually dissected, ternate, or pinnatifid, but simple and entire in some genera, e.g. Bupleurum. Commonly, their leaves emit a marked smell when crushed, aromatic to fetid, but absent in some species.\nThe defining characteristic of this family is the inflorescence, the flowers nearly always aggregated in terminal umbels, that may be simple or more commonly compound, often umbelliform cymes. The flowers are usually perfect (hermaphroditic) and actinomorphic, but there may be zygomorphic flowers at the edge of the umbel, as in carrot (Daucus carota) and coriander, with petals of unequal size, the ones pointing outward from the umbel larger than the ones pointing inward. Some are andromonoecious, polygamomonoecious, or even dioecious (as in Acronema), with a distinct calyx and corolla, but the calyx is often highly reduced, to the point of being undetectable in many species, while the corolla can be white, yellow, pink or purple. The flowers are nearly perfectly pentamerous, with five petals and five stamens.\nThere is often variation in the functionality of the stamens even within a single inflorescence. Some flowers are functionally staminate (where a pistil may be present but has no ovules capable of being fertilized) while others are functionally pistillate (where stamens are present but their anthers do not produce viable pollen). Pollination of one flower by the pollen of a different flower of the same plant (geitonogamy) is common. The gynoecium consists of two carpels fused into a single, bicarpellate pistil with an inferior ovary. Stylopodia support two styles and secrete nectar, attracting pollinators like flies, mosquitoes, gnats, beetles, moths, and bees. The fruit is a schizocarp consisting of two fused carpels that separate at maturity into two mericarps, each containing a single seed. The fruits of many species are dispersed by wind but others such as those of Daucus spp., are covered in bristles, which may be hooked in sanicle Sanicula europaea and thus catch in the fur of animals. The seeds have an oily endosperm and often contain essential oils, containing aromatic compounds that are responsible for the flavour of commercially important umbelliferous seed such as anise, cumin and coriander. The shape and details of the ornamentation of the ripe fruits are important for identification to species level.:\u200a802\n\nTaxonomy\nApiaceae was first described by John Lindley in 1836. The name is derived from the type genus Apium, which was originally used by Pliny the Elder circa 50 AD for a celery-like plant. The alternative name for the family, Umbelliferae, derives from the inflorescence being generally in the form of a compound umbel. The family was one of the first to be recognized as a distinct group in Jacques Daleschamps' 1586 Historia generalis plantarum. With Robert Morison's 1672 Plantarum umbelliferarum distribution nova it became the first group of plants for which a systematic study was published.\nThe family is solidly placed within the Apiales order in the APG III system. It is closely related to Araliaceae and the boundaries between these families remain unclear. Traditionally groups within the family have been delimited largely based on fruit morphology, and the results from this have not been congruent with the more recent molecular phylogenetic analyses. The subfamilial and tribal classification for the family is currently in a state of flux, with many of the groups being found to be grossly paraphyletic or polyphyletic.\n\nClassification and phylogeny\nPrior to molecular phylogenetic studies, the family was subdivided primarily based on fruit characteristics. Molecular phylogenetic analyses from the mid-1990s onwards have shown that fruit characters evolved in parallel many times, so that using them in classification resulted in units that were not monophyletic. In 2004, it was proposed that Apiaceae should be divided into four subfamilies:\nApioideae Seem.\nAzorelloideae G.M.Plunkett & Lowry\nMackinlayoideae G.M.Plunkett & Lowry\nSaniculoideae BurnettApioideae is by far the largest subfamily with about 90% of the genera. Most subsequent studies have supported this division, although leaving some genera unplaced. A 2021 study suggested the relationships shown in the following cladogram.\nThe Platysace clade and the genera Klotzschia and Hermas fell outside the four subfamilies. It was suggested that they could be accommodated in subfamilies of their own. Phlyctidocarpa was formerly placed in the subfamily Apioideae, but if kept there makes Apioideae paraphyletic. It could be placed in an enlarged Saniculoideae, or restored to Apioideae if the latter were expanded to include Saniculoideae.The subfamilies can be further divided into tribes and clades, with many clades falling outside formally recognized tribes.\n\nGenera\nThe number of genera accepted by sources varies. As of December 2022, Plants of the World Online (PoWO) accepted 444 genera, while GRIN Taxonomy accepted 462. The PoWO genera are not a subset of those in GRIN; for example, Haloselinum is accepted by PoWO but not by GRIN, while Halosciastrum is accepted by GRIN but not by PoWO, which treats it as a synonym of Angelica. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Website had an \"approximate list\" of 446 genera.\n\nEcology\nThe black swallowtail butterfly, Papilio polyxenes, uses the family Apiaceae for food and host plants for oviposition. The 22-spot ladybird is also commonly found eating mildew on these plants.\n\nUses\nMany members of this family are cultivated for various purposes. Parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), carrot (Daucus carota) and Hamburg parsley (Petroselinum crispum) produce tap roots that are large enough to be useful as food. Many species produce essential oils in their leaves or fruits and as a result are flavourful aromatic herbs. Examples are parsley (Petroselinum crispum), coriander (Coriandrum sativum), culantro, and dill (Anethum graveolens). The seeds may be used in cuisine, as with coriander (Coriandrum sativum), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), cumin (Cuminum cyminum), and caraway (Carum carvi).\nOther notable cultivated Apiaceae include chervil (Anthriscus cerefolium), angelica (Angelica spp.), celery (Apium graveolens), arracacha (Arracacia xanthorrhiza), sea holly (Eryngium spp.), asafoetida (Ferula asafoetida), galbanum (Ferula gummosa), cicely (Myrrhis odorata), anise (Pimpinella anisum), lovage (Levisticum officinale), and hacquetia (Sanicula epipactis).\n\nCultivation\nGenerally, all members of this family are best cultivated in the cool-season garden; they may not grow at all if the soils are too warm.  Almost every widely cultivated plant of this group is a considered useful as a companion plant. One reason is that the tiny flowers, clustered into umbels, are well suited for ladybugs, parasitic wasps, and predatory flies, which drink nectar when not reproducing. They then prey upon insect pests on nearby plants. Some of the members of this family considered \"herbs\" produce scents that are believed to mask the odours of nearby plants, thus making them harder for insect pests to find.\n\nOther uses\nThe poisonous members of the Apiaceae have been used for a variety of purposes globally. The poisonous Oenanthe crocata has been used as an aid in suicides, and arrow poisons have been made from various other family species.\nDaucus carota has been used as coloring for butter.\nDorema ammoniacum, Ferula galbaniflua, and Ferula moschata (sumbul) are sources of incense.\nThe woody Azorella compacta Phil. has been used in South America for fuel.\n\nToxicity\nMany species in the family Apiaceae produce phototoxic substances (called furanocoumarins) that sensitize human skin to sunlight. Contact with plant parts that contain furanocoumarins, followed by exposure to sunlight, may cause phytophotodermatitis, a serious skin inflammation. Phototoxic species include Ammi majus, Notobubon galbanum, the parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) and numerous species of the genus Heracleum, especially the giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum). Of all the plant species that have been reported to induce phytophotodermatitis, approximately half belong to the family Apiaceae.The family Apiaceae also includes a smaller number of poisonous species, including poison hemlock, water hemlock, spotted cowbane, fool's parsley, and various species of water dropwort.\nSome members of the family Apiaceae, including carrot, celery, fennel, parsley and parsnip, contain polyynes, an unusual class of organic compounds that exhibit cytotoxic effects.\nPassage 4:\nElodea\nElodea is a genus of 6 species of aquatic plants often called the waterweeds described as a genus in 1803. Classified in the frog\u2019s-bit family (Hydrocharitaceae), Elodea is native to the Americas and is also widely used as aquarium vegetation and laboratory demonstrations of cellular activities. It lives in fresh water. An older name for this genus is Anacharis, which serves as a common name in North America.The introduction of some species of Elodea into waterways in parts of Europe, Australia, Africa, Asia, and New Zealand has created a significant problem and it is now considered a noxious weed in these areas.\nElodea canadensis, sometimes called American or Canadian water weed or pond weed, is widely known as the generic water weed. The use of these names causes it to be confused with similar-looking plants, like Brazilian elodea (Egeria densa) or hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata). American water weed is an attractive aquarium plant and is a good substitute for Brazilian elodea. It can be used for science experiments in classrooms demonstrating how plants use carbon dioxide with the usage of bromothymol blue.\nThe American water weed lives entirely underwater with the exception of small white flowers which bloom at the surface and are attached to the plant by delicate stalks. It produces winter buds from the stem tips that overwinter on the lake bottom. It also often overwinters as an evergreen plant in mild climates. In the Autumn, leafy stalks will detach from the parent plant, float away, root, and start new plants. This is the American water weed's most important method of spreading, while seed production plays a relatively minor role.Silty sediments and water rich in nutrients favor the growth of American water weed in nutrient-rich lakes. However, the plants will grow in a wide range of conditions, from very shallow to deep water, and in many sediment types. It can even continue to grow uprooted, as floating fragments. It is found throughout temperate North America, where it is one of the most common aquatic plants.American water weed is an important part of lake ecosystems. It provides good habitat for many aquatic invertebrates and cover for young fish and amphibians. Waterfowl, especially ducks, as well as beaver, muskrat and aquatic turtles eat this plant. It is also of economic importance as an attractive and easy to keep aquarium plant, although in the states of Alabama, New Hampshire, New York, South Carolina, and Washington it has been deemed an invasive species and is illegal to sell.\nSpeciesElodea bifoliata H.St.John - Canada (AB, SK), W United States (OR + CA to NM + MN)\nElodea callitrichoides (Rich.)

H.St.John - much of United States + Canada\nElodea potamogeton (Bertero) Espinosa - Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador\n\nChemical control\nChemical methods are ineffective in eradicating Elodea \u2013 at best they only slow growth for a season or two. As Elodea spreads into new ecosystems, it experiences rapid growth for 5\u20136 years and then slows as soil nutrients are used up. Elodea is threatening aquatic environments across Europe. Chemicals may be used in places that cause undue economic concerns, but very few aquatic herbicides are registered for aquatic use in the EU. Fluridone, the most commonly used aquatic herbicide is highly effective against Hydrilla, but only marginally effective against Elodea, especially at lower use rates.\n\nMechanical control\nThe plants can also be removed from lakes and rivers mechanically. They are extracted either by hand or by using rakes, chains, mowing boats or weed buckets. The problem is that through vegetative reproduction via fragments, mechanical removal methods can contribute to the spread of the plant. Torn fragments can be transported downstream or are introduced to new environments via attachment to boats and anchor chains.\n\nSee also\nStormy Lake (Alaska) a lake where Fluoridone was successfully used to eliminate elodea\nPassage 5:\nApium annuum\nApium annuum is one of the 20 species of the genus Apium of the family Apiaceae.

Lee Ermey. It is a remake of the 2003 film Midsommer.\n\nPlot\nTeenager Megan (Elisabeth Harnois), still distraught over her twin sister Sophie's suicide, reluctantly agrees to join her friends on a summer trip to a lake house in the bayous of Louisiana. On the way, at a gas station, they meet Nick (Tyler Hoechlin), who provides the group with information on voodoo and other local superstitions.\nAs soon as they arrive at the house, Megan suspects Sophie is trying to communicate with her, as a solstice \u2014 the time when our world and the next are closest \u2014 approaches. Megan goes running and trips, splitting her nail (something she had foreseen in several nightmares). As she limps back to the house, she meets a suspicious local resident, Leonard (R. Lee Ermey); inside his pickup truck, she finds a hat identical to one Sophie had owned.\nThe night before the solstice, Nick joins the group at the house for dinner. Megan tells him about Sophie's key chain, something she is trying to get rid of but it keeps returning, and that she thinks she is being haunted by Sophie's lost ghost. The six of them later go swimming and Nick calls for any spirits with wine; Megan is dragged under the water. Megan then, advised by Nick, wraps the key chain in a white cloth and buries it outside, which he says should expel the spirit. She goes for a bath, finding mud running out of the taps, and then sees the key chain lying on the floor.\nThe following day, Megan goes to Leonard's house and, inside, finds a young girl's bedroom (presumably his daughter); newspaper cuttings explain a young girl called Malin disappeared from the town a year earlier. Megan realises she is being haunted by Malin, not Sophie. Megan takes Nick to where she tripped on her run, followed by the group of friends, including Christian (Shawn Ashmore) who brings a gun. Nick and Megan get split up, and Christian almost shoots Nick. Megan then digs up Malin's body and finds that the key on the key chain is for Malin's bicycle, which was buried with her. They call the local police.\nChristian finally admits that the year before, when they all came to the lake house without Megan, he and Sophie were on a drive and accidentally hit Malin. In fear of being arrested, they buried her in the forest, and Sophie later committed suicide as she could not bear the guilt. Malin's ghost appears, and Christian runs away towards the road. Megan chases him through the forest but before she can reach him, he is hit by the police car that had been called out.\nThe ending shows Megan at Malin's grave. When Leonard arrives home, he finds Malin's key chain on the porch, put there by Megan. Megan and Nick decide to go to the city to start a life together.\n\nCast\nElisabeth Harnois as Megan, a teenager who travels with her friends to a remote lake house during the summer solstice.

He said he hoped that it would \"hark back to elemental horror films like Rosemary's Baby and The Shining.\"  The film met with problems due to Hurricane Katrina and production was postponed. Filming commenced in New Orleans in April, 2006, shooting in the Garden District and in bayous around Louisiana.  Endgame Entertainment developed, produced, and fully financed the film.\n\nRelease\nSolstice released direct to video on January 1, 2008 by The Weinstein Company. Throughout the year, the film had international releases in Germany, Philippines and Greece. It had a theatrical release on June 19 in Russia, and a US television debut on Lifetime Television on July 26, before release in South Korea, Netherlands, Italy, the United Kingdom, Iceland and Mexico.\n\nCritical response\nSolstice has received mixed reviews upon release.\nDon Sumner of Best Horror Movies felt the production values were comparable with large-budget films and that both the story and performances were believable and genuine, making the film interesting enough to keep the viewer's attention. However, he also felt that the expected scares and suspense might make for an argument that the film was not a horror and was actually a ghostly drama/thriller. Bloody Disgusting felt that the music score was the only highlight in an otherwise boring film, granting that as a remake of the Danish film Midsommer, where the story, overused locale, etc. could not be attributed to Myrick or the other new writers, it is wondered why the choice was made to not make it more interesting, as even the feeling of danger was not present. For Dread Central, Steve Barton also found the pacing to be lagging when they wrote \"The pacing of Solstice drags the viewer to the finish line nearly half asleep\". And in referring to director Daniel Myrick, \"Coming from a guy whose body of work has been anything but cookie-cutter, Solstice disappoints with its surprising blandness and heavy-handed mediocrity.\"  E-Splatter was also disappointed in Myrick's work, comparing it negatively to The Blair Witch Project and writing that it was \"a bit of a bummer to see the filmmaker behind such a kick-ass movie helming a direct-to-video horror film that's as tame as this. As reviled as it was by some horror fans, 'The Blair Witch Project' definitely had an edge. This film absolutely, positively has none.\"\nPassage 5:\nA Special Cop in Action\nSpecial Cop in Action (Italian: Italia a mano armata, lit.\u2009'Italy at gunpoint') is a 1976 Italian poliziottesco film directed by Marino Girolami, here credited as Franco Martinelli.

The criminals agree and blindfolds him and take him away in the getaway car instead.\nBetti is dumped on the highway and sustained injuries, impressed by his bravery, Anna visits him in the hospital and apologizes for her earlier comments. Betti then begins to round up the syndicate members, first chasing two of them through a wet market. The two crooks flee, but Betti hijacks a car and goes after them. After a lengthy chase, Betti destroys their car and arrests them. Another crook was chased by Betti across the rooftops, the crook panics and shoots him, nearly making Betti fall off the building. They then climb down the scaffolding, the crook tries to hijack a nearby car but was T-boned by a speeding truck, killing him.\nBetti then goes to the syndicate headquarters, the local sailors' club in Turin. The criminals there set him up by having one of them shoot him.

Betti gives chase but was blocked by a piece of damaged scaffolding.\nThe boss of the syndicate prepares a meeting to consider the situation, but was run over by a biker gang as he prepares to board his limo. He was taken to a private hospital. Upon hearing the police are on their way, he escapes through a broken window and hails a taxi, with Betti following him. Being stalked at every turn and their arrests imminent, the remaining criminals gathers at the airport and prepares to flee Italy, with Betti watching their every move in a nearby car.\nAs revenge for taking down their operations, the syndicate orders a hit on Betti. While on a date with Anna, Betti was gunned down in a hail of bullets from a drive-by thus ending the trilogy story of Commissar Betti. However his death was not present in all versions of the film, leaving doubts on which ending is canon.\n\nCast\nMaurizio Merli: Commissioner Betti\nJohn Saxon: Jean Albertelli\nRaymond Pellegrin: Commissioner Arpino\nToni Ucci: Raffaele Cacace\nMirella D'Angelo: Luisa\nSergio Fiorentini: Salvatore Mancuso\nAldo Barberito: Maresciallo Ferrari\nMassimo Vanni: Fabbri\nEnzo Andronico: Antonio Boretti\nNello Pazzafini: Prisoner\n\nProduction\nSpecial Cop in Action is the final chapter in the trilogy about Commissioner Betti, after Violent Rome and Violent Naples.\n\nRelease\nSpecial Cop in Action was distributed theatrically in Italy by Fida on 27 November 1976.\n\nReception\nIn a contemporary review, John Pym reviewed a dubbed version of the film in the Monthly Film Bulletin. Pym found the film to be an \"over-plotted picture, filled with irrelevant characters (and character names), which attempts to justify its moments of thoroughly nasty (or thoroughly ludicrous) violence by the last-minute addition of the usual moral about the unhappiness of the policeman's lot\".\n\nSee also\nList of Italian films of 1976\nPassage 6:\nMarino Girolami\nMarino Girolami (1 February 1914 \u2013 20 February 1994) was an Italian film director and actor.\n\nBiography\nMarino Giorlami was born on 1 February 1914 in Rome, Italy.

Its imposing architecture dominates the surrounding village and landscape.\n\nArchitecture\nSt. Gevorg has a single large Byzantine-style red tile, octagonal umbrella dome that is centered over the church. The style of domed roof is uncommon in Armenia, especially on larger structures. The dome sits above an octagonal drum that is pierced by twelve small windows; pairs of windows on each of the four sides, and single windows on the other four sides. The church was renovated at least once.\nPassage 4:\nGeorge G. Finch\nMajor General George Griffin Finch (April 11, 1902 \u2013 January 3, 1986) was a senior officer in the United States Air National Guard who served as Chief of the Air Division, National Guard Bureau from 1948 to 1950. In 1953 he replaced General Mark W. Clark on the UN command delegation to the Korean armistice talks.\n\nMilitary career\nGeorge Griffin Finch was born on April 11, 1902, in Dade City, Florida. He began his military career during World War I, enlisting in the Aviation Section of the United States Army's Signal Corps in 1918. He remained in the Reserve Corps after the war and, in 1926, became Commander, 27th Pursuit Squadron, 1st Pursuit Group. In 1940, Georgia Governor Ed Rivers commissioned Finch to form the first flying unit of the Georgia Air National Guard. The unit was mobilized into the United States Army in September 1941, with Major Finch as commander.\nAfter World War II, Finch was a leading critic of efforts to eliminate the air arm of the National Guard during peacetime. He became the first Chief of the Air Force Division of the National Guard Bureau in 1948. Under his leadership, the Air National Guard built to combat readiness and was among the first components called into service after the outbreak of the Korean War.

Finch served as the senior Air Force member of the United Nations negotiating team at the peace talks at Panmunjom, Korea, and received the Legion of Merit for outstanding service in 1955. Finch assumed command of Fourteenth Air Force at Robins AFB, Georgia, becoming the nation's first Air National Guardsman to head a numbered air force.

It was built to house some of the remains of Saint George who was known as the \"Slayer of Dragons\".\n\nArchitecture\nThe church of Saint Gevork stands within a rectangular walled monastery. It has a single cylindrical drum notable for the horizontal alternating striped pattern that surrounds it, and a conical umbrella type dome above. The striped pattern repeats some within the interior portion of the dome. The front fa\u00e7ade is made up of a triple-arched walkway with an arch on either side adjacent that leads underneath a belfry. The belfry consists of sixteen equally spaced columns with an equal amount of smaller arches that support the weight of the cupola above.\nA main portal leads into the church decorated by an intricately carved arched lintel and door frame. Another smaller doorway is located on the fa\u00e7ade to the right of the front of the church. It is almost as intricately carved as the main entry door.\nMany portions of the stonework on the church of Saint Gevork use two colors of stone; a darker grey tuff and an apricot colored tuff. In particular the doorways, the drum, the peaks of the fa\u00e7ades, and the capitals of the rectangular columns of the triple-archway in front are accentuated by the alternating stone colors.\nIn the interior of the church there are numerous religious frescoes around the apse and on the left wall leading to the tomb of S. George of whom the church is named after. They were most likely painted in the 17th century by Naghash Hovnatan whose other works include decoration of the Etchmiadzin Cathedral and other churches near Yerevan and Agulis. A single marble tomb sits in a room adjacent to the apse with semi-circular stone of green marble on top worn down from the many people who have touched it. It is said to come from Jerusalem. A chapel built in the 6th century had at one point served to house the remains of S. George, but was later replaced by the church of Saint Gevork.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of churches under the patronage of Saint George\nPassage 6:\nSaint Gevork of Mughni Church, Tbilisi\nThe Saint Gevork of Mughni Church (Armenian: \u0544\u0578\u0582\u0572\u0576\u0565\u0581\u057e\u0578\u0581 \u054d\u0578\u0582\u0580\u0562 \u0533\u0587\u0578\u0580\u0563 \u0535\u056f\u0565\u0572\u0565\u0581\u056b Georgian: \u10ec\u10db\u10d8\u10dc\u10d3\u10d0 \u10d2\u10d8\u10dd\u10e0\u10d2\u10d8\u10e1 \u10db\u10e3\u10e6\u10dc\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d4\u10d9\u10da\u10d4\u10e1\u10d8\u10d0) also known as Saint George of Mughni Church (Gevork in Armenian is cognate with George) is a 13th-century Armenian church in Tbilisi, Georgia that was entirely rebuilt in 1756.  It is made of brick and its architectural typology is that of a cross within a rectangular perimeter, with four free-standing supports.\n\nCurrent state\nUntil the mid-1980s, the church served as a museum of folk art.  By 1990, it was no longer a museum and its interior lay in ruin.The vestibule attached to the western facade of the church was destroyed in May, 1991. The large cracks in the church walls served as an excuse to Georgian authorities to destroy the church instead of repairing it.During the night of November 18, 2009, the dome of the church collapsed. According to locals, recent rains had further weakened the already badly damaged structure of the church. Georgian television station Rustavi 2 reports that the district governor promised to allocate funds for the rehabilitation of the church after visiting the ruin on November 19, 2009.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nArmenians in Georgia\nPassage 7:\nGeorge Stambolian\nGeorge Stambolian (born April 10, 1938 \u2013 December 22, 1991, New York City) was an American educator, writer, and editor of Armenian descent. Stambolian was a key figure in the early gay literary movement that came out of New York during the 1960s and 1970s.  He was best known as the editor of the Men on Men anthologies of gay fiction.\nStambolian graduated from Dartmouth College and carried out graduate studies at the University of Wisconsin, earning a Ph.D. in 1969 with a dissertation that was subsequently published as Marcel Proust and the Creative Encounter (1972). From 1966 until his retirement in 1991, Stambolian was a professor in the Department of French at Wellesley College, where he taught courses on French language and literature.  He wrote and edited Twentieth Century French Fiction: Essays for Germaine Br\u00e9e (1975) and, with Elaine Marks, Homosexualities and French Literature (1979).\nMen on Men: Best New Fiction, edited by Stambolian and including an introduction he wrote, was published by New American Library (Plume) in 1986. The anthology featured the work of some prominent gay authors of that period as well as others less well established. The critical acclaim accorded this volume and its popular success led to the publication of three sequels which Stambolian likewise edited and introduced.  He was awarded the 1990 Lambda Literary Award in the category Gay Men's Anthologies for editing Men on Men 3.

Nelson proposes 'ontogenetic depth' as evidence of specified complexity, and a reliable marker of design by an intelligent agent, in opposition to modern evolutionary theory.\nNelson subsequently stated that ontogenetic depth is \"Currently Impossible to Measure\".\n\nCriticism\nBiologist PZ Myers, who works in the field of evolutionary developmental biology, dismissed the concept, stating in 2010 that \"Nelson is a creationist who made up this wacky claim of \"ontogenetic depth\", saying he had a way of objectively measuring the complexity of the developmental process in organisms with a number that described the distance from egg to adult. Unfortunately, he forgot to tell us how one calculated this number, or how it actually accounted for the complexity of a network, or even how we'd get a number that was different for a sponge and a cat. But he did say he'd get back to us with the details tomorrow...six years ago.\" Myers concludes that \"ontogenetic depth is a sloppily-defined concept with no theoretical support for its validity and no apparent operational utility.\"The concept of 'ontogenetic depth' has not been published in any peer-reviewed journal, there are no methods described that would allow to measure this value in any organisms, nobody other than Nelson and his collaborator, Marcus Ross, do anything with the idea.\nPassage 4:\nKevin Avery\nKevin Avery (born June 24, 1957) is an American biographer, short story writer, and editor.

Interview subjects included NBA star Shaquille O\u2019Neal, musical acts Radiohead, Freedy Johnston, Los Lobos, Tori Amos, Moody Blues, Graham Parker, and Sheryl Crow, cartoonist John Callahan, and late impresario Eugene Jelesnik. Avery's music criticism was greatly influenced by the work of Paul Nelson (critic), whose work he'd begun reading as a teenager.Beginning in 2006, upon learning of Nelson's death, Avery spent four years researching and writing Everything Is an Afterthought: The Life and Writings of Paul Nelson, an anthology-biography compiling some of Nelson's best works while also documenting the critic's tragic life. In addition to interviewing Nelson's friends, family, and fellow critics, Avery interviewed some of the artists about whom Nelson wrote, including Bruce Springsteen, Jackson Browne, Elliott Murphy, Bruce Hornsby, Suzanne Vega, and Rod Stewart.From 2010 to 2011, Avery edited Conversations with Clint: Paul Nelson's Lost Interviews with Clint Eastwood, 1979 - 1983, compiled from interview tapes with Clint Eastwood found in Paul Nelson's apartment after his death. Critic Robert Christgau called the book, which was published eight weeks before Everything Is an Afterthought, \"astonishingly thorough.\"In October 2016, he published his third book (his second for Fantagraphics) It's All One Case: The Illustrated Ross Macdonald Archives, editing Paul Nelson's forty hours of interviews with detective writer Ross Macdonald.He founded Mere Words Media Relations, a boutique public relations firm that provides a full array of affordable publicity services.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2005, Avery moved to New York City to pursue his writing career, and where in 2006, he got married.

Nelson (born 1958) is an American philosopher, noted for his advocacy of the pseudosciences of young earth creationism and intelligent design.\n\nBiography\nNelson is the grandson of the creationist author and Lutheran minister Byron Christopher Nelson (1894\u20131972) and edited a book of his grandfather's writings.  He is married to Suzanne Nelson, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University.\nIn 1998, Nelson gained a PhD in philosophy from the University of Chicago.\nNelson is a fellow of the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture and of the International Society for Complexity, Information and Design.\n\nControversies\nThe Discovery Institute's Wedge Document, and other sources have said that Nelson publishes works derived from his dissertation, \"Common Descent, Generative Entrenchment, and the Epistemology in Evolutionary Inference\", in which he criticizes the principle of common descent as it is expounded in the Evolutionary Monographs series.\nNelson is frequently cited by opponents of intelligent design as an example of ID's \"big tent\" strategy in action. He has written about \"Life in the Big Tent\" in the Christian Research Journal. In an interview for Touchstone Magazine Nelson said that the main challenge facing the ID community was to \"develop a full-fledged theory of biological design\", and that the lack of such a theory was a \"real problem\".As shown in the Peabody Award-winning documentary Nova: Intelligent Design on Trial, in the Kitzmiller v. Dover trial, Barbara Forrest presented a quote from Nelson to demonstrate that Intelligent Design proponents know that it is not a theory in the scientific sense:\n\nEasily, the biggest challenge facing the I.D. community is to develop a full-fledged theory of biological design. We don't have such a theory right now, and that's a real problem. Without a theory, it's very hard to know where to direct your research focus. Right now, we've got a bag of powerful intuitions and a handful of notions, such as irreducible complexity, but as yet, no general theory of biological design.\n\nYoung Earth views\nNelson was a contributor to the book Three Views on Creation and Evolution, edited by J. P. Moreland and John Mark Reynolds, in which he, along with Reynolds, represented the young Earth creationist position. In their discussion in that book he and Reynolds acknowledged that \"natural science at the moment seems to overwhelmingly point to an old cosmos.\" Ideas consistent with present-day Young Earth creationism were abandoned around the start of the 19th century. Today, such proposals are rejected by the scientific community, and the courts have ruled Young Earth creationism to be a religious belief.In a discussion with historian of science Ronald Numbers, Nelson made a distinction between his theological understanding of Earth history, which is informed by the biblical account as presented in the book of Genesis, and his advocacy for intelligent design. Nelson acknowledged that his young-Earth views are unpopular with many other intelligent design advocates.Nelson was a cast member in the 2017 creationist documentary film Is Genesis History?. After the film's release, he published an article stating that the film distorted his arguments and presented \"a false dichotomy\" between naturalistic evolution and young Earth creationism while omitting other viewpoints. Director and Producer Thomas Purifoy wrote a response entitled A Tale of Two Dichotomies in which he presented the full film interview with Nelson as evidence and stated that \"as a philosopher, Paul seemed to be shifting back to viewing things from a philosophical perspective. The film, however, was not about comparing two different philosophies, but two different histories.\"\nPassage 10:\nOld Coyote Town\n\"Old Coyote Town\" is a song recorded by American country music artist Don Williams.  It was released in January 1989 as the fourth single from the album Traces.  The song reached number 5 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. The song previously appeared on co-writer Larry Boone's 1988 album Swingin' Doors, Sawdust Floors, and was the B-side to that album's single \"Wine Me Up\".

The 5 sponsored varsity sports are: Men's Baseball, Women's Soccer, Men's Basketball, Women's Basketball, Cheerleading (Club).Intramural sports vary from year to year based on interest levels,\n\nIn Fall: Flag Football, Sand Volleyball, and Tennis.\nIn Winter: Dodgeball and Kickball.\nIn Spring: Basketball, Sand Volleyball, Soccer, Softball, and Tennis.\nPassage 4:\nRudolph Hall\nRudolph Hall (built as the Yale Art and Architecture Building, nicknamed the A & A Building, and given its present name in 2007) is one of the earliest and best-known examples of Brutalist architecture in the United States. Completed in 1963 in New Haven, Connecticut, the building houses Yale University's School of Architecture. Until 2000, it also housed the School of Art.\n\nConstruction\nDesigned by the building's namesake, architect Paul Rudolph, the complex building contains more than 30 floor levels in its seven stories. The building is made of ribbed, bush-hammered concrete. The design was influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright's Larkin Administration Building in Buffalo, New York, and the later buildings of Le Corbusier.\n\nHistory\nThe building was dedicated on November 8, 1963, to wide praise by critics and academics. It received several prestigious awards, including the Award of Honor by the American Institute of Architects. New York Times architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable called it \"a spectacular tour de force.\" But the building also had detractors from the start. In a speech at the dedication ceremony, architecture historian Nikolaus Pevsner bemoaned what he called the structure's oppressive monumentality.Over the following decade, the critical reaction to the building became more negative.A large fire on the night of June 14, 1969, caused extensive damage. The fire was rumored to have been set by anti-establishment protesters, but this charge has remained unproven.During the repairs, many changes were made to Rudolph's original design. Mezzanine levels were inserted, spaces broken up, and double-glazing added. Later, a renovation scheme by Beyer Blinder Belle was commissioned but only partially executed, if at all.In 2000, the School of Art moved out to its own building.  \nAs the building approached its 40th year, appreciation of the structure had increased to the point that Yale began planning a renovation and addition. In 2001, initial commissions were given to David Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill for the former and Richard Meier for the latter. Then Yale \"parted ways\" with those two, and gave the commission to Gwathmey Siegel & Associates Architects, whose Charles Gwathmey was a Yale Architecture alumnus and former student of Rudolph's. Yale spent $126 million on the project between 2007 and 2008, including a $20 million gift for the purpose from alumnus Sid Bass. The renovation returned the building to more closely hew to Rudolph's design. At the same time, an addition was built with classroom and office space, two lecture theatres, a cafe, and a ground-floor library.In 2014, the building received the Landmark Plaque, the highest honor bestowed by the New Haven Preservation Trust.\n\nSee also\nYale School of Architecture\nYale School of Art\nPassage 5:\nKyle Ezell\nKyle Ezell (born Jonathan Kyle Ezell in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee) is an American urban planning practitioner, writer, and theorist.  Ezell focuses on vibrant downtowns and expressing local culture in the built environment. He is currently a professor and head of the undergraduate planning program of the Knowlton School at Ohio State University.Ezell received a Master of Science in Geography from South Dakota State University in 1994. Prior to joining Ohio State University's Knowlton School, he practiced as an urban planner in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Dublin, Ohio, and Columbus, Ohio.

Knowlton School of Architecture (KSA) at The Ohio State University. The building was completed in 2004. The School of Architecture offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees in the fields of Architecture, Landscape Architecture, and City and Regional Planning. Knowlton Hall serves as the replacement for Ives Hall, the previous home of the school of architecture which was demolished in July 2002. The namesake of Knowlton Hall is Austin E. \"Dutch\" Knowlton. He graduated from The Ohio State University in 1931 with a Bachelor's in Architectural Engineering and provided a $10 million donation that spearheaded the funding for the creation of the building.\n\nArchitecture\nInitially, the brief for the building was to renovate the existing building, Ives Hall, and plan an addition to accommodate anticipated programming. As the architect, Mack Scogin Merrill Elam Architects, worked, they realized it would be better to build anew with the primary goal of the building to inspire its students.The structure is post-tensioned concrete construction and white Georgia marble as stipulated by the donor. The marble was used as shingles in a rainscreen that could be easily replaced and allow light inside.The resulting building form is monumental with enclosing, defining, and confronting space and adjacent buildings with a sense of elegance reflected in its green space. Designed by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, the landscape attempts to increase nature on the site through landform strips around the building's perimeter and construction of an arboreal bosque.\n\nDesign and organization\nKnowlton Hall houses a 30,000 volume library, 65 offices, 45 studio spaces, a workshop, its own caf\u00e9, and a large auditorium that serves not only as one of the six classrooms in Knowlton but also as a stage for the KSA lecture series.  The KSA lecture series bring students into close contact with prominent researchers and practitioners of architecture, landscape architecture, and city planning. As one member of an award jury for the American Institute of Architects (AIA) said in regards to Knowlton Hall:\n\nWhat architect would not have liked to have gone to school here? This project embodies everything I would want in an architecture building. It is full of unique spaces, an open flexible hall that beckons people to participate, and seems to have surprises around every corner. 'Our buildings shape us,' as Churchill said, and to have future generations of architects learn and grow as designers within an inspiring building such as this ... is exhilarating.\n\nRecognition\nSince its completion in 2004, Knowlton Hall has been the subject of a lot of attention, not only within the local community of Columbus but also nationally. Knowlton Hall has gained recognition by national publications, such as Architecture, Competitions, Dwell, Praxis, and Architectural Record, and has also been the recipient of numerous awards:\nAmerican Institute of Architects, National; Architecture Honor Award, 2010\nAmerican Institute of Architects/American Library Association; Award of Excellence, 2005\nAmerican Institute of Architects, Georgia; Honor Award, 2006\nAmerican Institute of Architects, Ohio; Honor Award, 2005\nAmerican Institute of Architects, Columbus; Honor Award, 2009\nAmerican Council of Engineering Companies; National Recognition Award, 2005\nAmerican Council of Engineering Companies, Ohio; Grand Award, 2005\n\"International Masonry Institute\", Ohio; Golden Trowel Award, 2005\nPost Tensioning Institute; Award of Excellence, 2004\nColumbus Landmarks; James B.

Built from 1909 to 1910, it is the oldest building still standing at Cal Poly. \nThe design of the building was long mis-attributed to William H. Weeks, who had designed the original Cal Poly power house at the northern end of campus. However, the architectural plans for the 1909 building were created by the State of California Department of Engineering, under State Engineer Nat Ellery.The building is designed in the Mission Revival style. The building originally served as a power plant run by students and two full-time supervisors; it also held Mechanics and Electrical Engineering classes. The Powerhouse stopped generating power in the 1940s and was replaced entirely and abandoned in 1955. In 1967, the building found a new use when the school's College of Architecture and Environmental Design decided to hold classes there. The college continued to hold classes in the building even after the construction of a new architecture building, and only stopped in 1990 when the school's administration ordered the building to be abandoned.The Powerhouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 30, 1993.\nPassage 9:\nJohn Quigley (academic)\nJohn B.

Thompson, the retired editor of Life magazine, was asked by the then-Secretary of the Smithsonian, S. Dillon Ripley, to produce a magazine \"about things in which the Smithsonian [Institution] is interested, might be interested or ought to be interested.\"Thompson would later recall that his philosophy for the new magazine was that it \"would stir curiosity in already receptive minds. It would deal with history as it is relevant to the present. It would present art, since true art is never dated, in the richest possible reproduction. It would peer into the future via coverage of social progress and of science and technology. Technical matters would be digested and made intelligible by skilled writers who would stimulate readers to reach upward while not turning them off with jargon. We would find the best writers and the best photographers\u2014not unlike the best of the old Life.\"In 1973, the magazine turned a profit for the first time. By 1974, circulation had nearly quadrupled, to 635,000, and it reached the one million milestone in 1975\u2014one of the most successful launches of its time.

As of 2020 census, Dazhou was home to 5,385,422 inhabitants whom 1,850,869 lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of 2 urban districts.\n\nHistory\nDazhou's history goes back to the Eastern Han Dynasty when in 90 AD it was made a county by the name of Liweizhou (\u5386\u4e3a\u5dde). Then until the Liao Dynasty its name was Zaidi (\u5728\u5730). During the Liao and Tang dynasties its name was again changed, this time to Tongzhou (\u901a\u5dde). Finally in the Song Dynasty it was given its present name of Dazhou.\nNotable people from Dazhou include the Three Kingdoms writer Chen Shou, Song Dynasty astronomer Zhang Sixun, and Ming and Qing Dynasty philosopher and educator Tang Zhen. Dazhou also made notable contributions to the Communist Revolution. Red Army heroes such as Xu Xiangqian, Li Xiannian, Xu Shiyou, Wang Weizhou (\u738b\u7ef4\u821f), and Zhang Aiping were all from or lived in Dazhou.\nThe partially preserved mausoleum complex (in particular, its gate towers, known as que of the Shen (\u6c88) family in Qu County,\ndating from the Han Dynasty, is a well-known  architectural monument.\n\nGeography and climate\nDazhou is the easternmost prefecture-level division of the province, bordering Ankang and Hanzhong (both in Shaanxi) to the north, Chengkou County, Kai County, and Wanzhou District of Chongqing to the east, the Chongqing counties of Liangping and Dianjiang to the south, Guang'an to the southwest, Nanchong to the west, and Bazhong to the northwest. It is centrally located between Chongqing and Xi'an. The area is 16,600 square kilometres (6,400 sq mi).\nThe terrain is largely mountainous (Daba Mountains and adjacent ranges).\nTypical of the Sichuan Basin, Dazhou has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and is largely mild and humid, with four distinct seasons. Winter is short, mild, and foggy, though actual precipitation is low. January averages 6.1 \u00b0C (43.0 \u00b0F) and, while frost may occur, snow is rare. Summers are long, hot and humid, with highs often exceeding 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F). The monthly daily average in July, the warmest month, is 27.4 \u00b0C (81.3 \u00b0F). Rainfall is light in winter and can be heavy in summer, and over 70% of the annual total occurs from May to September. The annual frost-free period lasts around 300 days.\n\nAdministration\nIt is one of Sichuan's most populous cities with 5,468,097 residents as of 2010 census.\n\nEconomy\nDazhou is an important river and land transportation hub for the region. Numerous national highways, expressways, and rail lines pass through Dazhou connecting it directly with major cities in China such as Chengdu, Xi'an, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Beijing, etc., making it one of Sichuan's important trade centers.\nDazhou has numerous natural resources including large natural gas fields and an abundance of mineral resources such as salt, coal, manganese, lithium, and limestone. Major agricultural products include pork, beef, and tea. Other industries are chemical production, coal power, metallurgy, textiles, building materials, and processed food.\n\nTourism\nDazhou is blessed with both cultural and natural attractions. There are several national and provincial cultural sites and many national and provincial protected forests and nature reserves. Xuanhan's Baili Gorges have scenery and rapids, leading to the nickname \"Little Three Gorges\". Mountains are this area's greatest attraction.\n\nPoints of interest\nIn Dazhou, there is a residential building with 16 floors with a 20 metres tall electricity pylon on the roof [1].\n\nTransportation\nChina National Highway 210\nXiangyu Railway (Xiangyang, Hubei\u2212Chongqing)\nDazhou\u2013Chengdu railway\nA branch line from Dacheng to Wanzhou, Chongqing where it connects with the Yiwan Railway\nDazhou Jinya Airport, a new airport opened in May 2022\nPassage 2:\nYandu District\nYandu District (simplified Chinese: \u76d0\u90fd\u533a; traditional Chinese: \u9e7d\u90fd\u5340; pinyin: Y\u00e1nd\u016b Q\u016b; lit.

The pipeline runs from Pugang gas field in Dazhou, Sichuan Province, to Qingpu District of Shanghai.   An 842 kilometres (523 mi) long branch line connects Yichang in Hubei  with Puyang in Henan Province. Two shorter branches are located near the Puguang gas field and one in the east near Shanghai.The construction of the first 1,360 kilometres (850 mi) long section from Yichang in Hubei Province to Shanghai started on 22 May 2007 and was completed in March 2010.  The tunnel to cross Yangtze River was completed in October 2007. The tunnel is about 20 metres (66 ft) beneath the riverbed and connects two wells on each side of the river.The capacity of the pipeline is 12 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas per year.  It has eight centrifugal compressors, provided by GE Oil & Gas.  The operator of the pipeline is Sinopec.

Located on the Jiangsu North Plain with a coastline of 112 km (70 mi), Dafeng was historically one of the largest salt-making areas in China and now is famed for its well preserved eco-system and numerous national conservation parks. The district has the largest national nature reserve for a rare deer species, P\u00e8re David's Deer or Milu (\u9e8b\u9e7f) in Chinese. It borders the prefecture-level city of Taizhou to the southwest.\nThe district nicknamed \"the enclave of Shanghai\" was a major destination for the sent-down youth from the city.

He was the son of Alberic II (son of Alberic I of Spoleto and Marozia), and Alda of Vienne (daughter of Hugh, King of Italy and his second wife, Alda (or Hilda)). His half-brother was Pope John XII.\nHe held the cities of Galeria, Arce, and Preneste and the title count palatine, the palace referred to being that of the Lateran. He was the first to carry the title \"Count of Tusculum\" and he passed it to all his descendants. They also received the titles of excellentissimus vir' (most excellent man) and apostolic rector of Sant'Andrea, which Gregory received in 980. In 981, Gregory bore the title Romanorum consul, dux et senator: \"Consul, duke, and senator of the Romans.\"\nAs well as being an intimate and ally of the popes, especially Sylvester II, Gregory also served as praefectus navalis of Holy Roman Emperors Otto I and Otto II. However, on 6 February 1001, he was named \"Head of the Republic\" by the Romans for leading the revolt against Otto III and expelling the Crescentii. In 1002, the latter returned to power and he had to renounce his title.\nHis death is attested before the 11 June 1012, when his successor, Theophylact, was elected Pope.\n\nMarriage and issue\nBy his wife Maria (died 1013) he had three sons and a daughter:\n\nTheophylact, who became Pope Benedict VIII.\nAlberic III who succeeded him in Tusculum and in his titles.\nRomanus, who became Pope John XIX\nMarozia III, who married Thrasimund III of Spoleto.

His half-brother was Pope John XI. At the wedding of his mother to King Hugh of Italy, Alberic and his new stepfather quarreled violently after Hugh slapped Alberic for clumsiness. Infuriated by this and perhaps motivated by rumors that Hugh intended to have him blinded, Alberic left the festivities and incited a Roman mob to revolt against Hugh. In December 932 Hugh fled the city, Marozia was cast into prison, and Alberic took control of Rome.\n\nMarriage and issue\nIn 936 Alberic married his stepsister Alda, the daughter of King Hugh of Italy and had one son by her, Count Gregory I of Tusculum. According to Benedict of Soracte, he also had one illegitimate son, Octavianus, by an unknown mistress. On his deathbed Alberic had Roman nobility and clergy swear they would elect Octavianus as pope.\n\nSources\nWilliams, George L. (1998). Papal Genealogy: The Families and Descendants of the Popes. McFarland & Company, Inc.\nLexikon des Mittelalters.\nPassage 4:\nMarozia\nMarozia, born Maria and also known as Mariuccia or Mariozza (c. 890 \u2013 937), was a Roman noblewoman who was the alleged mistress of Pope Sergius III and was given the unprecedented titles senatrix (\"senatoress\") and patricia of Rome by Pope John X.\nEdward Gibbon wrote of her that the \"influence of two sister prostitutes, Marozia and Theodora was founded on their wealth and beauty, their political and amorous intrigues: the most strenuous of their lovers were rewarded with the Roman tiara, and their reign may have suggested to darker ages the fable of a female pope. The bastard son, two grandsons, two great grandsons, and one great great grandson of Marozia\u2014a rare genealogy\u2014were seated in the Chair of St. Peter.\" Pope John XIII was her nephew, the offspring of her younger sister Theodora. From this description, the term \"pornocracy\" has become associated with the effective rule in Rome of Theodora and her daughter Marozia through male surrogates.\n\nEarly life\nMarozia was born about 890. She was the daughter of the Roman consul Theophylact, Count of Tusculum, and of Theodora, the real power in Rome, whom bishop Liutprand of Cremona characterized as a \"shameless whore... [who] exercised power on the Roman citizenry like a man.\"\nAt the age of fifteen, Marozia became the mistress of Theophylact's cousin Pope Sergius III, whom she knew when he was bishop of Portus. The two had a son, John (the later Pope John XI). That, at least, is the story found in two contemporary sources, the Liber Pontificalis and the Antapodosis sive Res per Europam gestae (958\u201362), by Liutprand of Cremona (c. 920\u201372). But a third contemporary source, the annalist Flodoard (c. 894\u2013966), says John XI was brother of Alberic II, the latter being the offspring of Marozia and her husband Alberic I. Hence John too may have been the son of Marozia and Alberic I.\nMarozia married Alberic I, duke of Spoleto, in 909, and their son Alberic II was born in 911 or 912. By the time Alberic I was killed at Orte in 924, the Roman landowners had won complete victory over the traditional bureaucracy represented by the papal curia. Rome was virtually under secular control, the historic nadir of the papacy.\n\nGuy of Tuscany\nIn order to counter the influence of Pope John X (whom the hostile chronicler Liutprand of Cremona alleges was another of her lovers), Marozia subsequently married his opponent Guy of Tuscany. Together they attacked Rome, arrested Pope John X in the Lateran, and jailed him in the Castel Sant'Angelo. Either Guy had him smothered with a pillow in 928 or he simply died, perhaps from neglect or ill treatment. Marozia seized power in Rome in a coup d'\u00e9tat. The following popes, Leo VI and Stephen VII, were both her puppets. In 931 she managed to impose her twenty-one years old son as pontiff, under the name of John XI.\n\nHugh of Arles, and death\nGuy died in 929, and Marozia negotiated a marriage with his half-brother Hugh of Arles, the King of Italy. While in Rome Hugh quarreled with Marozia's son Alberic II, who organized an uprising during the wedding ceremonies in 932. Hugh escaped, but Marozia was captured.\nMarozia died after spending some 5 years in prison. Her descendants remained active in papal politics, starting with Alberic II's son Octavian, who became Pope John XII in 955. Popes Benedict VIII, John XIX, and Benedict IX, and antipope Benedict X of the House of Tusculani, were also descended from Marozia. By Guy of Tuscany she had a daughter named Berta Theodora, who never married.\n\nFamily tree\nSources\nChamberlin, E. R. (1969). The Bad Popes. New York: Dial Press. ISBN 9789030041801.

He was son of Alberic III of Dammartin and Mathilde of Clermont.Brought up at the French court, he was a childhood friend of Philip Augustus. At his father's insistence he fought for the Plantagenets. Received back into Philip's favour, he married Marie de Ch\u00e2tillon, daughter of Guy II de Ch\u00e2tillon and Ad\u00e8le of Dreux, a royal cousin.\nIn 1191, Renaud's father, Alberic, kidnapped and had Renaud marry Ida, Countess of Boulogne. The County of Boulogne thereby became vassal to the French king, rather than the count of Flanders. While this marriage made Renaud a power, it also made enemies in the Dreux family and that of the count of Gu\u00eenes, who had been betrothed to Ida.\nIn 1203, Renaud and his wife gave a merchant's charter to Boulogne. This was probably made for financial consideration. Philip made Renaud Count of Aumale the following year, but Renaud began to detach himself. Following the acquisition of Normandy in April 1204, King Philip granted Renaud the county of Mortain and the honor of Warenne which was centered on the fortresses of Mortemer and Bellencombre.  Both Mortain and Warenne had been held by William I of Boulogne and it would appear that King Philip recognized the Boulogne claim to them.\nIn 1211, he refused to appear before Philip in a legal matter, a suit with Philippe de Dreux, bishop of Beauvais. Philip II seized his lands and on 4 May 1212 at Lambeth, Dammartin made an agreement with King John who had also lost possessions to Philip. Renaud brought other continental nobles, including the Count of Flanders, into a coalition with John against Philip. In return he was given several fiefs in England and an annuity. Each promised not to make a separate peace with France.With the Emperor Otto IV and Ferdinand of Flanders, he took part in the attack on France in 1214 culminating in the Battle of Bouvines. Commanding the Braban\u00e7ons, he was on the losing side, but was one of the last to surrender, and refused submission to Philip Augustus. His lands were taken away, and given to Philip Hurepel. Renaud was kept imprisoned at P\u00e9ronne for the rest of his life, which ended in suicide.  His daughter Matilda II was married to Philip Hurepel.\nPassage 6:\nAlberic II, Count of Dammartin\nAlberic II (died 1183) was the Count of Dammartin, possibly the son of Aubry de Mello, Count of Dammartin, and Adela, daughter of Hugh I, Count of Dammartin.What little is known for sure about Alberic II is confounded by the preponderance of noblemen of the same name in both France and England. What is known is that he married Cl\u00e9mence of Bar, daughter of Reginald I \"One-Eyed\", Count of Bar, one of the leaders of the Second Crusade, and Gis\u00e8le de Vaud\u00e9mont, daughter of Gerard I, Count of Vaud\u00e9mont.\nAlberic and Cl\u00e9mence had one son:\n\nAlberic III, Count of Dammartin.Alberic II was succeeded by his son Alberic III as Count of Dammartin upon his death.\nThe discussion in Aubry, Count of Dammartin, provides some insight into how Alberic III came to claim the countship. Further complicating the genealogy, Cl\u00e9mence, widowed, married Renaud II, Count of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis, her second husband and his second wife. Renaud and his first wife, Adelaide, Countess of Vermandois, were the parents of Mathilde, wife of Alberic III.\n\nSources\nMathieu, J.

A nominee of the princeps of Rome, Alberic II of Spoleto, his pontificate occurred during the period known as the Saeculum obscurum.\n\nPontificate\nAgapetus was born to a Roman father (a descendant of Consul Anicius Faustus Albinus Basilius) and a Greek mother. He was elected pope on 10 May 946 after the death of Marinus II. The existence of an independent republic of Rome, ruled by Alberic II of Spoleto, meant that Agapetus was prevented from exercising any temporal or secular power in Rome and the Papal States. The struggle between Berengar II and Otto I for the Kingdom of Italy allowed Alberic to exercise complete control over Rome and Agapetus, meaning the pope was largely limited to managing internal church affairs. Even Agapetus\u2019 invitation to Otto to intervene in Italian affairs in 951 was done at the instigation of Alberic, who was growing concerned at Berengar's growing power. However, when Otto's envoys, the bishops of Mainz and Chur, were sent to the pope to discuss Otto's reception in Rome and other more important questions, they were turned away by Alberic.Agapetus was forced to intervene in the dispute over the occupancy of the See of Reims. He ordered a synod to be held at Ingelheim in June 948 to resolve the rights of the rival claimants, Hugh of Vermandois and Artald of Reims. He sent his legate Marinus of Bomarzo to act on his behalf, while Agapetus wrote to a number of bishops, asking them to be present at the council. Through his legate the pope indicated his support for King Louis IV of France, and gave his support for reinstalling Artald as bishop of Reims. This council was followed up by another one at Trier, where Agapetus was again represented by Marinus of Bomarzo. In 949, Agapetus held a synod in Rome, which confirmed the rulings of the two councils. It condemned the former bishop Hugh and it excommunicated his father, Count Herbert II of Vermandois, for his opposition to King Louis IV.After receiving requests from both Louis IV of France and Otto I of Germany, Agapetus granted privileges to monasteries and nunneries within their respective kingdoms. He also was sympathetic towards Otto's plans to restructure the bishoprics within Germany, which were eventually aborted due to pressure exerted by William of Mainz. Around 948, Agapetus, granted the Archbishop of Hamburg the right of consecrating bishops in Denmark and other northern European countries instead of the pope. The pope was also allegedly asked by a Danish king named Frode, now considered legendary, to send missionaries to his kingdom.Agapetus was also asked to intervene in a dispute between Herhold, archbishop of Salzburg and Gerard, bishop of Lauriacum, who both claimed the title of metropolitan of all Pannonia. Agapetus dispatched a letter to the two claimants, in which he stated that the diocese of Lauriacum had been the metropolitan church of all Pannonia before the invasion of the Huns. However, following the ravages inflicted by them, the metropolitan had transferred his see to another city, and since that time Salzburg had been raised to an archbishopric. Consequently, both lawfully occupied their respective sees, and both were to retain their rank and diocese. Agapetus ruled that jurisdiction over western Pannonia would rest with Herhold, while the eastern part, along with the regions occupied by the Avars and the Moravians, would fall under Gerard.In Italy, Agapetus wrote to the dukes of Beneventum and Capua, demanding that monasteries be returned to the monks whom they had displaced. He also deposed the bishops of Termoli and Trivento who were accused of simony. Hoping to rejuvenate the religious life of the clerics in Italy, Agapetus, with the blessing of Alberic, asked for the abbot of Gorze Abbey to send some of his monks down and join the monastic community attached to the church of Saint Paul Outside the Walls.Agapetus died on 8 November 955, and was succeeded by Alberic's son, Octavian, who took the papal name of John XII. He was buried in the Lateran basilica, behind the apse, and close to the tombs of Leo V and Paschal II. Agapetus was noted for his caution and for the sanctity with which he led his life.\nPassage 9:\nPope Leo VII\nPope Leo VII (Latin: Leo VII; died 13 July 939) was the bishop of Rome and nominal ruler of the Papal States from 3 January 936 to his death.\n\nElection\nLeo VII's election to the papacy in 936, after the death of Pope John XI, was secured by Alberic II of Spoleto, the ruler of Rome at the time. Alberic wanted to choose the pope so that the papacy would continue to yield to his authority. Leo was the priest of the church of San Sisto Vecchio in Rome, thought to be a Benedictine monk. He had little ambition towards the papacy, but consented under pressure.\n\nPontificate\nAs pope, Leo VII reigned for only three years. Most of his bulls were grants of privilege to monasteries, especially including the Abbey of Cluny. Leo called for Odo of Cluny to mediate between Alberic and King Hugh of Italy. Odo was successful in negotiating a truce after arranging a marriage between Hugh's daughter Alda and Alberic. Leo VII also appointed Archbishop Frederick of Mainz as a reformer in Germany. Leo allowed Frederick to drive out Jews that refused to be baptized, but he did not endorse the forced baptism of Jews.Leo VII died on 13 July 939, and was interred at St. Peter's Basilica. He was succeeded by Stephen VIII.\nPassage 10:\nSimon, Count of Ponthieu\nSimon of Dammartin (1180 \u2013 21 September 1239) was a son of Alberic III of Dammartin (Aubry de Dammartin) and his wife Mathildis of Clermont,  heiress to the county of Clermont and daughter of Renaud II, Count of Clermont.\n\nBiography\nSimon was the brother of Renaud I, Count of Dammartin, who had abducted the heiress of Boulogne, and forced her to marry him. It is thought that in order to strengthen the alliance with the Dammartins, King Philip Augustus of France allowed Simon to marry Marie, Countess of Ponthieu, who was a niece of the king, in 1208. Renaud and Simon of Dammartin would eventually ally themselves with John, King of England. In 1214 the brothers stood against Philip Augustus in the Battle of Bouvines. The French won the battle, and Renaud was imprisoned, while Simon was exiled.\nMarie's father William IV, Count of Ponthieu had remained loyal to Philip Augustus. When William died in 1221, Philip Augustus denied Marie her inheritance and gave Ponthieu in custody to his cousin Robert III, Count of Dreux. After the death of Philip Augustus, Marie was able to negotiate an agreement with his successor Louis VIII in 1225. Ponthieu was held by the king, and Simon would only be allowed to enter this or any other fief if he obtained royal permission. In 1231 Simon agreed to the terms and added that he would not enter into marriage negotiations for his daughters without consent of the king.\n\nFamily\nSimon married Marie, Countess of Ponthieu, the daughter of  William IV, Count of Ponthieu and Alys, Countess of the Vexin. Marie became Countess of Ponthieu in 1225.Simon and his wife Marie had four daughters:\n\nJoan, Countess of Ponthieu (1220\u20131278), married 1) Ferdinand III of Castile.

De Bois made 64 appearances in the attack of Ajax, scoring 11 goals and helping his team to win the national championship in the 1930\u201331 season, his final season with the club.\n\nManagerial career\nAs one of the first football managers to be certified by the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB), De Bois took a managerial position with BVV De Kennemers in 1931. After three seasons he became manager of Hermes DVS, only to manage Sportclub Enschede three seasons later. From 1941 to 1948 he was the manager of DFC (now known as FC Dordrecht).\nIn 1948, De Bois became the manager of the Dutch Guyana national team, Dutch Guyana being the predecessor of Suriname, as the Dutch colony was known prior to 1976. He made his first appearance as newly appointed manager on 18 December 1948 in a 4\u20133 loss to Martinique.After his brief stint in South America, De Bois returned to the Netherlands, taking the manager position at VV DOS in Utrecht.

It is the capital of the province of Overijssel and the province's second-largest municipality after Enschede with a population of 130,592 as of 1 December 2021. Zwolle borders on the province of Gelderland and is east of the river IJssel.\n\nHistory\nArchaeological findings indicate that the area surrounding Zwolle has been inhabited for a long time. A woodhenge that was found in the Zwolle-Zuid suburb in 1993 was dated to the Bronze Age period. During the Roman era, the area was inhabited by Salian Franks.\nThe modern city was founded around 800 CE by Frisian merchants and troops of Charlemagne. Previous spellings of its name include the identically pronounced Suolle, which means \"hill\" (cf. the English cognate verb \"to swell\"). This refers to an incline in the landscape between the four rivers surrounding the city, IJssel, Vecht, Aa and Zwarte Water. The hill was the only piece of land that would remain dry during the frequent floodings of the rivers. Zwolle was established on that incline.\n\nA document mentions the existence of a parish church dedicated to St Michael. That church, the Grote of Sint Micha\u00eblskerk (St. Michael's church), was renovated in the first half of the 15th century and exists to this day. The church contains a richly carved pulpit, the work of Adam Straes van Weilborch (about 1620), some good carving and an exquisite organ (1721).\nOn 31 August 1230, the bishop of Utrecht granted Zwolle city rights. Zwolle became a member of the Hanseatic league in 1294, and in 1361 joined the war between the Hanseatic League and Valdemar IV of Denmark. In the 1370 Treaty of Stralsund that ended the war, Zwolle was awarded a vitte, a trade colony, in Scania, then part of Denmark. Zwolle's golden age came in the 15th century. Between 1402 and 1450, the city's Gross Regional Product multiplied by about six.In July 1324 and October 1361, regional noblemen set fire to Zwolle. In the 1324 fire, only nine buildings escaped the flames.\nZwolle was also, with Deventer, one of the centers of the Brethren of the Common Life, a monastic movement. 5 km (3 mi) from Zwolle, on a slight eminence called the Agnietenberg, (hill of St Agnes), once stood the Augustinian convent in which Thomas \u00e0 Kempis spent the greatest part of his life and died (in 1471).At least as early as 1911, Zwolle had a considerable trade by river, a large fish market, and the most important cattle market in the Netherlands after Rotterdam. The more important industries comprised cotton manufactures, iron works, boat-building, dyeing and bleaching, tanning, rope-making, and salt-making.\nIn World War II, Zwolle was single-handedly liberated from the Germans by French-Canadian soldier L\u00e9o Major. He was made an honorary citizen of Zwolle in 2005 and a street is named after him, Leo Majorlaan.\n\n21st century\nIn 2004, Zwolle's De Librije restaurant was honored with 3 stars by Michelin Guide; as of 2018, it is one of only three restaurants so honored in the entire country.In 2023, Tewelde Goitom, an Eritrean convicted in Ethiopia of migrant smuggling, kidnapping in Sinai and human trafficking appeared at a pretrial hearing in Zwolle, which made international headlines.\n\nBlauwvingers\nCitizens of Zwolle are colloquially known as Blauwvingers (Bluefingers). This dates back to 1682, when the St Michael's church tower collapsed. The authorities were strapped for cash and saw no option but to sell the church bells to neighbouring city Kampen. To make sure that Kampen would not make too much profit from the deal, the local authorities asked a high price for the church bells. Kampen accepted, yet after the arrival of the bells it became clear, they were too damaged to be played. In revenge, Kampen paid in copper coins of four duiten (the equivalent of two-and-a-half cents). Zwolle distrusted Kampen and wanted to be sure they truly paid the entire price. After the rigorous counting of this vast amount of money, their fingers had turned blue from the counting of money.\n\nGeography\nBesides the Grote of Sint Micha\u00eblskerk (St. Michael's church), the latter which houses a majestic Baroque organ built by Arp Schnitger, there are several other historic monuments in Zwolle. The Roman Catholic Onze Lieve Vrouwe ten Hemelopneming-basilica (Our Lady of the Assumption) dates back to 1399. The church tower, called Peperbus (pepperpot), is one of the tallest and most famous church towers in the Netherlands. The modernized town hall was originally built in 1448.Mention should also be made of the Sassenpoort (one of the old city gates), the city walls, the Mosterdmakerstoren (mustard makers' tower)(the complex where local mustard used to be made), a guild-house (1571), the former provincial government offices, a Dominican monastery, and on the Melkmarkt, two museums; the Stedelijk Museum Zwolle of antiquities and natural history, and the Vrouwenhuis. Museum de Fundatie, the fine art museum of the province of Overijssel, is hosted in the former Justice Hall on Blijmarkt Square.\nIn the western part of the city, west of the railway station, there is a quarter of Art Nouveau buildings, concentrated mostly on Koningin Wilhelminastraat, Prinses Julianastraat, and Prins Hendrikstraat. These three-store living houses were built in 1900s by various Dutch architects. Eleven of the buildings are protected by the Dutch government (rijksmonumenten).\nThe Broerenkerk church was part of the Dominican monastery founded in 1465. The monastery was closed in 1580 and the monks were expelled. From 1640 until 1982 the church was used for Protestant services. After a restoration in 1983\u20131988 it has been used for cultural events and it is now a bookstore.\n\nImage gallery\nNotable residents\nSee also People from Zwolle\nArts, culture, entertainment and the mediaWillem Victor Bartholomeus (1825\u20131892), organist and conductor\nHein Boele (born 1939), actor, Dutch voice of Elmo\nJonnie Boer (born 1965), chef with three Michelin stars\nGerard ter Borch (1617\u20131681), painter\nGerard ter Borch the Elder (1583\u20131662), painter\nMoses ter Borch (1645\u20131667), painter\nTooske Breugem (born 1974), television host actress\nHerman Brood (1946\u20132001), painter/rock star\nFunda Eryi\u011fit (born 1984), Turkish actress\nWillem Grasdorp (1678\u20131723), painter\nAleida Greve (1670\u20131742), painter\nAnna Cornelia Holt (1671\u20131692), painter\nSophia Holt (1658\u20131734), painter\nAntonina Houbraken (1686\u20131736), draughtswoman\nMarnix Kappers (1943\u20132016), actor\nThomas \u00e0 Kempis (c.\u20091380\u20131471), canon and mystic\nMaster I.

This is reflected in the high traffic volumes in and around the city. The A28 serves Zwolle with 4 exits, and runs from Utrecht to Groningen. It is being widened to 8 lanes across the IJssel River and 6 lanes from Zwolle to Meppel in 2010 and 2011. The motorway initially opened between 1964 and 1970. Another motorway, the A50, interchanges with A28 just west of the city, offering a route for southbound traffic to Apeldoorn and Eindhoven.\nThe N35 highway starts in Zwolle, where it forms the eastern section of the ring road of Zwolle, it runs as a non-motorway to Almelo and continues to Enschede as A35 motorway. The ringroad is mainly a 4-lane road, with numerous traffic lights. It forms a full ring, and also exists out of the N337 highway that runs to Deventer. Other sections of the ring road are not numbered. Parts of the ring road were widened to six lanes in 2010. Other numbered highways running from Zwolle are N331 to Hasselt, N758 to Nieuwleusen, N340 to Ommen and N764 to Kampen.\n\nBridges\nDue to nearby rivers, there are several major bridges in and around Zwolle. The most important bridge is the IJssel Bridge where the A28 motorway runs across. It was completed in 1970 and carries over 125.000 vehicles per day. Adjacent to this bridge is the older IJssel Bridge, which opened in 1930 and was destroyed twice during World War II. A third IJssel Bridge is the railway bridge (called Hanze boog) which carries the railway line from Zwolle to Amersfoort, and from 2012, to Lelystad. There are several bridges across the Zwarte Water River, including two 4-lane bridges, a 2-lane bridge, and a bus/bicycle bridge. There is also a bridge across the Vecht, which carries A28 motorway. Another local bridge is adjacent to this bridge. A third bridge carries rail traffic to Leeuwarden and Groningen. Numerous local bridges exist around the historic city center.\n\nRail transport\nZwolle railway stationThe first train in Zwolle arrived on 6 June 1864. Today the city has rail connections in eight directions (viz. Kampen, Leeuwarden, Groningen, Emmen, Enschede, Arnhem/Nijmegen, Lelystad/Amsterdam, and Amersfoort).\nThe rail connection with Amsterdam via Lelystad \u2013 the Hanzelijn \u2013 is operational since December 2012.\nThe second station, Zwolle Stadshagen, was opened on 15 December 2019.\n\nWater transport\nZwolle is located on or near three rivers (Zwarte Water, Vecht, and IJssel), several canals (the now disused Willemsvaart, Nieuwe Vecht and Overijssels Kanaal and the modern Zwolle-IJssel Kanaal).

The centre-back and full-back positions are essential in most modern formations. The sweeper and wing-back roles are more specialised for certain formations dependent on the manager's style of play and tactics. Centre-backs are usually tall and positioned for their ability to win duels in the air.\n\nCentre-back\nThe centre-back (also known as a central defender or centre-half, as the modern role of the centre-back arose from the centre-half position) defends in the area directly in front of the goal and tries to prevent opposing players, particularly centre-forwards, from scoring. Centre-backs accomplish this by blocking shots, tackling, intercepting passes, contesting headers and marking forwards to discourage the opposing team from passing to them. In the modern game, most teams employ two or three centre-backs in front of the goalkeeper. The 4\u20132\u20133\u20131, 4\u20133\u20133, and 4\u20134\u20132 formations all use two centre-backs.\n\nIn possession of the ball, centre-backs are generally expected to make long and pinpoint passes to their teammates, or to kick unaimed long balls down the field. For example, a clearance is a long unaimed kick intended to move the ball as far as possible from the defender's goal. Due to the many skills centre-backs are required to possess in the modern game, many successful contemporary central-defensive partnerships have involved pairing a more physical defender with a defender who is quicker, more comfortable in possession and capable of playing the ball out from the back; examples of such pairings have included David Luiz, Gary Cahill, John Terry and Ricardo Carvalho with Chelsea, Sergio Ramos, Rapha\u00ebl Varane or Pepe with Real Madrid, Diego God\u00edn and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Uruguay, Nemanja Vidi\u0107 and Rio Ferdinand with Manchester United, or Giorgio Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci, Andrea Barzagli and Medhi Benatia with Juventus.Under normal circumstances, centre-backs are unlikely to score goals. However, when their team takes a corner kick or other set pieces, centre-backs may move forward to the opponents' penalty area; if the ball is passed in the air towards a crowd of players near the goal, then the heading ability of a centre-back is useful when trying to score. In this case, other defenders or midfielders will temporarily move into the centre-back positions.\nThere are two main defensive strategies used by defensive lines: the zonal defence, where each centre-back covers a specific area of the pitch; and man-to-man marking, where each centre-back has the job of tracking a particular opposition player. In the now obsolete man\u2013to\u2013man marking systems such as catenaccio, as well as the zona mista strategy that later arose from it, there were often at least two types of centre-backs who played alongside one another: at least one man\u2013to\u2013man marking centre-back, known as the stopper, and a free defender, which was usually known as the sweeper, or libero, whose tasks included sweeping up balls for teammates and also initiating attacks.\n\nSweeper (libero)\nThe sweeper (or libero) is a more versatile centre-back who \"sweeps up\" the ball if an opponent manages to breach the defensive line. This position is rather more fluid than that of other defenders who man-mark their designated opponents. Because of this, it is sometimes referred to as libero, which is Italian for \"free\".Austrian manager Karl Rappan is thought to be a pioneer of this role, when he incorporated it into his catenaccio or verrou (also \"doorbolt/chain\" in French) system with Swiss club Servette during the 1930s, deciding to move one player from midfield to a position behind the defensive line, as a \"last man\" who would protect the back-line and start attacks again. As coach of Switzerland in the 1930s and 1940s, Rappan played a defensive sweeper called the verrouilleur, positioned just ahead of the goalkeeper.During his time with Soviet club Krylya Sovetov Kuybyshev in the 1940s, Aleksandr Abramov also used a position similar to a sweeper in his defensive tactic known as the Volzhskaya Zashchepka, or the \"Volga clip\". Unlike the verrou, his system was not as flexible and was a development of the WM rather than the 2\u20133\u20135, but it also featured one of the half-backs dropping deep; this allowed the defensive centre-half to sweep in behind the full-backs.In Italy, the libero position was popularised by Nereo Rocco's and Helenio Herrera's use of catenaccio. The current Italian term for this position, libero, which is thought to have been coined by Gianni Brera, originated from the original Italian description for this role libero da impegni di marcatura (i.e., \"free from man-marking tasks\"); it was also known as the \"battitore libero\" (\"free hitter\", in Italian, i.e. a player who was given the freedom to intervene after their teammates, if a player had got past the defence, to clear the ball away). In Italian football, the libero was usually assigned the number six shirt.One of the first predecessors of the libero role in Italy was used in the so\u2013called \"vianema\" system, a predecessor to catenaccio, which was used by Salernitana during the 1940s. The system originated from an idea that one of the club's players \u2013 Antonio Valese \u2013 posed to his manager Giuseppe Viani. Viani altered the English WM system \u2013 known as the sistema in Italy \u2013 by having his centre-half-back retreat into the defensive line to act as an additional defender and mark an opposing centre-forward, instead leaving his full-back (which, at the time, was similar to the modern centre-back role) free to function as what was essentially a sweeper, creating a 1\u20133\u20133\u20133 formation; he occasionally also used a defender in the centre-forward role, and wearing the number nine shirt, to track back and mark the opposing forwards, thus freeing up the full-backs from their marking duties. Andrea Schianchi of La Gazzetta dello Sport notes that this modification was designed to help smaller teams in Italy, as the man\u2013to\u2013man system often put players directly against one another, favouring the larger and wealthier teams with stronger individual players.\n\nIn Italy, the libero is also retroactively thought to have evolved from the centre-half-back role in the English WM system, or sistema, which was known as the centromediano metodista role in Italian football jargon, due to its association with the metodo system; in the metodo system, however, the \"metodista\" was given both defensive and creative duties, functioning as both a ball\u2013winner and deep-lying playmaker. Juventus manager Felice Borel used Carlo Parola in the centre-half role, as a player who would drop back into the defence to mark opposing forwards, but also start attacks after winning back possession, in a similar manner to the sweeper, which led to the development of this specialised position. Indeed, Herrera's catenaccio strategy with his Grande Inter side saw him withdraw a player from his team's midfield and instead deploy them further-back in defence as a sweeper.Prior to Viani, Ottavio Barbieri is also thought by some pundits to have introduced the sweeper role to Italian football during his time as Genoa's manager. Like Viani, he was influenced by Rappan's verrou, and made several alterations to the English WM system or \"sistema\", which led to his system being described as mezzosistema. His system used a man-marking back-line, with three man-marking defenders and a full-back who was described as a terzino volante (or vagante, as noted at the time by former footballer and Gazzetta dello Sport journalist Renzo De Vecchi); the latter position was essentially a libero, which was later also used by Viani in his vianema system, and Rocco in his catenaccio system.Though sweepers may be expected to build counter-attacking moves, and as such require better ball control and passing ability than typical centre-backs, their talents are often confined to the defensive realm. For example, the catenaccio system of play, used in Italian football in the 1960s, often employed a predominantly defensive sweeper who mainly \"roamed\" around the back line; according to Schianchi, Ivano Blason is considered to be the first true libero in Italy, who \u2013 under manager Alfredo Foni with Inter and subsequently Nereo Rocco with Padova \u2013 would serve as the last man in his team, positioned deep behind the defensive line, and clearing balls away from the penalty area. Armando Picchi was subsequently also a leading exponent of the more traditional variant of this role in Helenio Herrera's Grande Inter side of the 1960s.The more modern libero possesses the defensive qualities of the typical libero while being able to expose the opposition during counterattacks by carrying or play the ball out from the back. Some sweepers move forward into midfield, and distribute the ball up-field, while others intercept passes and get the ball off the opposition without needing to hurl themselves into tackles. If the sweeper does move up the field to distribute the ball, they will need to make a speedy recovery and run back into their position. In modern football, its usage has been fairly restricted, with few clubs in the biggest leagues using the position.\n\nThe modern example of this position is most commonly believed to have been pioneered by Franz Beckenbauer, and subsequently Gaetano Scirea, Morten Olsen and El\u00edas Figueroa, although they were not the first players to play this position. Aside from the aforementioned Blason and Picchi, earlier proponents also included Alexandru Apolzan, Velibor Vasovi\u0107, and J\u00e1n Popluh\u00e1r. Giorgio Mastropasqua was known for revolutionising the role of the libero in Italy during the 1970s; under his Ternana manager Corrado Viciani, he served as one of the first modern exponents of the position in the country, due to his unique technical characteristics, namely a player who was not only tasked with defending and protecting the back-line, but also advancing out of the defence into midfield and starting attacking plays with their passing after winning back the ball. Other defenders who have been described as sweepers include Bobby Moore, Daniel Passarella, Franco Baresi, Ronald Koeman, Fernando Hierro, Miodrag Belodedici, Matthias Sammer, and Aldair, due to their ball skills, vision, and long passing ability. Though it is rarely used in modern football, it remains a highly respected and demanding position.\nRecent and successful uses of the sweeper include by Otto Rehhagel, Greece's manager, during UEFA Euro 2004. Rehhagel utilized Traianos Dellas as Greece's sweeper to great success, as Greece became European champions. For Bayer Leverkusen, Bayern Munich and Inter Milan, Brazilian international L\u00facio adopted the sweeper role too, but was also not afraid to travel long distances with the ball, often ending up in the opposition's final third.\nAlthough this position has become largely obsolete in modern football formations, due to the use of zonal marking and the offside trap, certain players such as Daniele De Rossi, Leonardo Bonucci, Javi Mart\u00ednez and David Luiz have played a similar role as a ball-playing central defender in a 3\u20135\u20132 or 3\u20134\u20133 formation; in addition to their defensive skills, their technique and ball-playing ability allowed them to advance into midfield after winning back possession, and function as a secondary playmaker for their teams.Some goalkeepers, who are comfortable leaving their goalmouth to intercept and clear through balls, and who generally participate more in play, such as Ren\u00e9 Higuita, Manuel Neuer, Edwin van der Sar, Fabien Barthez, Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen, Bernd Leno and Ederson, among others, have been referred to as sweeper-keepers.\n\nFull-back\nThe full-backs (the left-back and the right-back) locate the holding wide positions and traditionally stay in defence at all times, until a set-piece. There is one full-back on each side of the field except in defences with fewer than four players, where there may be no full-backs and instead only centre-backs.In the early decades of football under the 2\u20133\u20135 formation, the two full-backs were essentially the same as modern centre-backs in that they were the last line of defence and usually covered opposing forwards in the middle of the field.The later 3\u20132\u20135 style involved a third dedicated defender, causing the left and right full-backs to occupy wider positions. Later, the adoption of 4\u20132\u20134 with another central defender led the wide defenders to play even further over to counteract the opposing wingers and provide support to their own down the flanks, and the position became increasingly specialised for dynamic players who could fulfil that role as opposed to the central defenders who remained fairly static and commonly relied on strength, height and positioning.\n\nIn the modern game, full-backs have taken on a more attacking role than was the case traditionally, often overlapping with wingers down the flank. Wingerless formations, such as the diamond 4\u20134\u20132 formation, demand the full-back to cover considerable ground up and down the flank. Some of the responsibilities of modern full-backs include:\n\nProvide a physical obstruction to opposition attacking players by shepherding them towards an area where they exert less influence. They may manoeuvre in a fashion that causes the opponent to cut in towards the centre-back or defensive midfielder with their weaker foot, where they are likely to be dispossessed. Otherwise, jockeying and smart positioning may simply pin back a winger in an area where they are less likely to exert influence.\nMaking off-the-ball runs into spaces down the channels and supplying crosses into the opposing penalty box.\nThrow-ins are often assigned to full-backs.\nMarking wingers and other attacking players. Full-backs generally do not commit to challenges in their opponents' half. However, they aim to quickly dispossess attacking players who have already breached the defensive line with a sliding tackle from the side. Markers must, however, avoid keeping too tight on opponents or risk disrupting the defensive organization.\nMaintaining tactical discipline by ensuring other teammates do not overrun the defensive line and inadvertently play an opponent onside.\nProviding a passing option down the flank; for instance, by creating opportunities for sequences like one-two passing moves.\nIn wingerless formations, full-backs need to cover the roles of both wingers and full-backs, although defensive work may be shared with one of the central midfielders.\nAdditionally, attacking full-backs help to pin both opposition full-backs and wingers deeper in their own half with aggressive attacking intent. Their presence in attack also forces the opposition to withdraw players from central midfield, which the team can seize to its advantage.Due to the physical and technical demands of their playing position, successful full-backs need a wide range of attributes, which make them suited for adaptation to other roles on the pitch. Many of the game's utility players, who can play in multiple positions on the pitch, are natural full-backs. Two rather prominent examples are former A.C. Milan left-back Paolo Maldini and the PSG full-back Sergio Ramos, who have played on the flanks as full-backs and in central defence throughout their career. In the modern game, full-backs often chip in a fair share of assists with their runs down the flank when the team is on a counter-attack. The more common attributes of full-backs, however, include:\n\nPace and stamina to handle the demands of covering large distances up and down the flank and outrunning opponents.\nA healthy work rate and team responsibility.\nMarking and tackling abilities and a sense of anticipation.\nGood off-the-ball ability to create attacking opportunities for their team by running into empty channels.\nDribbling ability. Many of the game's eminent attacking full-backs are excellent dribblers in their own right and occasionally deputize as attacking wingers.\nPlayer intelligence. As is common for defenders, full-backs need to decide during the flow of play whether to stick close to a winger or maintain a suitable distance. Full-backs that stay too close to attacking players are vulnerable to being pulled out of position and leaving a gap in the defence. A quick passing movement like a pair of one-two passes will leave the channel behind the defending full-back open. This vulnerability is a reason why wingers considered to be dangerous are double-marked by both the full-back and the winger. This allows the full-back to focus on holding their defensive line.Full-backs rarely score goals, as they often have to stay back to cover for the centre-backs during corner kicks and free kicks, when the centre backs usually go forward to attempt to score from headers. That said, full-backs can sometimes score during counterattacks by running in from the wings, often involving one-two passing moves with midfield players.\n\nWing-back\nThe wing-back is a variation on the full-back, but with a heavier emphasis on attack. Wing-backs are typically some of the fastest players on a team, when employed. Wing-backs are typically used in a formation with three centre-backs and are sometimes classified as midfielders instead of defenders. They can, however, be used in formations with only two centre-backs, such as in J\u00fcrgen Klopp's 4\u20133\u20133 system that he uses at Liverpool, in which the wing-backs play high up the field to compensate for a lack of width in attack. In the evolution of the modern game, wing-backs are the combination of wingers and full-backs. As such, this position is one of the most physically demanding in modern football. Successful use of wing-backs is one of the main prerequisites for the 3\u20134\u20133, 3\u20135\u20132 and 5\u20133\u20132 formations to function effectively.\nWing-backs are often more adventurous than full-backs and are expected to provide width, especially in teams without wingers. A wing-back needs to be of exceptional stamina, be able to provide crosses upfield and defend effectively against opponents' attacks down the flanks. A defensive midfielder may be fielded to cover the advances of wing-backs. It can also be occupied by wingers and side midfielders in a three centre-back formation, as seen by ex-Chelsea, ex-Inter Milan, and ex- Tottenham Hotspur manager Antonio Conte.\nExamples of players who could and did play as wing-backs were AC Milan teammates Cafu and Serginho, Barcelona player Dani Alves, Roberto Carlos of Real Madrid's Gal\u00e1cticos era, former River Plate's defender Juan Pablo Sor\u00edn, World Cup winning German Andreas Brehme, Parma's legend Antonio Benarrivo, Angelo Di Livio of Juventus and Italy and former Corinthians, Arsenal and Barcelona star Sylvinho.\n\nSee also\nPassage 8:\n1982 Bulgarian Cup Final\nThe 1982 Bulgarian Cup final was the 42nd final of the Bulgarian Cup (in this period the tournament was named Cup of the Soviet Army), and was contested between Lokomotiv Sofia and Lokomotiv Plovdiv on 12 June 1982 at Slavi Aleksiev Stadium in Pleven.

Locations include the following:\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge, where John the Baptist walks down the pedestrian walkway while humming \"Prepare Ye the Way of the Lord\" in the opening sequence;\nBethesda Fountain in Central Park, in which the new disciples are baptized by John while singing \"Prepare Ye\";\nThe Andrew Carnegie Mansion, in which they sing \"Turn Back, O Man\";\nTimes Square, where Jesus and John are silhouetted by a screen of lights as they dance to \"All For the Best\";\nThe central fountain at Lincoln Center, where Jesus and Judas dance on the fountain's stone lip as they sing \"All for the Best\";\nThe top of North Tower of the World Trade Center, which was nearing completion at the time of the film's production;\nThe Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument on Riverside Drive;\nA bird's-eye view of Fifth Avenue from above and behind St. Patrick's Cathedral, looking down on the Tishman Building  during \"Beautiful City\";\nThe exterior and interior of the Cherry Lane Theatre \u2013 where the first musical version of Godspell began its off-Broadway run the year before the film was shot \u2013 where the story of The Prodigal Son is told.\nThe long approaches of the Hell Gate Bridge on Randall's Island, where the disciples switch to their colorful clothing after baptism near the start of the film, and where they carry Jesus' body through the arches, creating a barrel-vaulted cathedral effect, after his crucifixion on a chain-link fence.Vocally, the chorus is very much in the same style, but solo parts are, at times, more lyrical. Notably, in \"All Good  Gifts\", whereas Lamar Alford had used a dramatic tenor voice, Merrell Jackson uses a lighter voice and falsetto for the high ornament, which creates a joyous effect.\nRegarding the band, all four of the musicians from the original stage production and cast album were retained for the film recording. These musicians were Steve Reinhardt on keyboards, Jesse Cutler on acoustic and lead guitar and bass, Richard LaBonte on rhythm guitar and bass, and Ricky Shutter on drums and percussion. Reviewer William Ruhlmann explains that by having a larger budget than had been available for the stage, Schwartz was able to expand the line-up by adding key studio personnel such as lead guitarist Hugh McCracken (on \"Prepare Ye (The Way of the Lord)\"), keyboardist Paul Shaffer, bass player Steve Manes, a horn section, and six strings.Ruhlmann describes Schwartz as being \"better able to realize the score's pop tendencies than he had on the cast album... this was a less complete version of the score, but it was much better performed and produced, making this a rare instance in which the soundtrack album is better than the original cast album.\u201d\n\nReception\nThe film was entered into the 1973 Cannes Film Festival.Godspell received generally positive reviews in 1973. Allmovie Guide gives the film a three out of five rating. Various bands have covered songs from the film/musical.\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 67% based on reviews from 15 critics.The film was recognized by the American Film Institute in 2006: AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers \u2013 Nominated.\n\nSee also\nList of American films of 1973\nGodspell (1971 Off-Broadway Cast)\nJesus Christ Superstar\nJesus Christ Superstar (film)\nPassage 3:\nMadame Sin\nMadame Sin is a 1972 British thriller film directed by David Greene and starring Bette Davis, Robert Wagner, Denholm Elliott and Gordon Jackson.

The few friends whom they make among the locals, including Susannah's aunt Agatha, warn them that the family mill is cursed and urge the Keltons to leave immediately and never look back.\nRefusing to bow to superstition, the couple consider rebuilding the abandoned mill. They become the target of a gang of local thugs led by Susannah's lecherous cousin, Ethan. Their reign of terror is ended by something still living in the shuttered attic room of the mill, something that caused Susannah to have nightmares as a child.\n\nCast\nGig Young as Mike Kelton\nCarol Lynley as Susannah Whately Kelton / Sarah\nOliver Reed as Ethan\nFlora Robson as Aunt Agatha\nJudith Arthy as Emma\nRick Jones as Luther Whately\nAnn Bell as Mary Whately\nWilliam Devlin as Zebulon Whately\nCharles Lloyd-Pack as Barge Master\nBernard Kay as Tait\nDonald Sutherland as Zebulon (voice)\nCelia Hewitt as Aunt Sarah\nRobert Cawdron as Luther Whately\nMurray Evans as gang member\nClifford Diggins as gang member\nPeter Porteous as gang member\nAnita Anderson as Susannah as a child\n\nProduction\nThe script was originally written by Alexander Jacobs and Nathaniel Tanchuck.

(also known as What Ever Happened to Baby Jane...?) is a 1991 American made-for-television thriller film directed by David Greene and adapted for the small screen by Brian Taggert. It is based on the 1960 novel What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? by Henry Farrell and the 1962 theatrical film of the same name. It stars real-life sisters Lynn Redgrave as Baby Jane Hudson and Vanessa Redgrave as Blanche Hudson, in the roles previously played by Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in the 1962 adaptation.\nThe film was adapted to contemporary times, with Blanche's film success taking place in the 1960s instead of the 1930s. Her films were being rediscovered on home video instead of television reruns. Jane had been a child film star (replacing the original's vaudeville success), though her films were unavailable, leading to her jealousy.\n\nPlot\nIn the 1940s, \"Baby\" Jane Hudson is a world-famous child star. Jane dominates her shy sister Blanche, who, as Jane's understudy and stunt double, longs to have an acting career of her own. By the 1960s, Blanche has become a serious and celebrated actress, while Jane's career fades into obscurity. Blanche's own career is ultimately cut short by a car accident that paralyzes her from the waist down, after which Jane was committed to a psychiatric hospital. Everyone believes that Jane, jealous of her sister's popularity, had run her over with her car and then gone insane with guilt.\nIn the present day, the aging sisters live together in a crumbling Brentwood mansion, where Jane, who still dresses herself in her old Baby Jane clothes and makeup, cares for the paraplegic Blanche. Blanche's films have recently become available on home video and television, launching her into a modest comeback. Jane resents both her sister's enduring popularity and her own role as caretaker and takes out her resentment on Blanche with vicious pranks. She intercepts all of the mail addressed to her sister, particularly fan letters, and constantly reminds Blanche that she never would have had a career if not for Jane's success. Blanche and her physical therapist, Dominick, worry that Jane's pranks might turn violent if she finds out Blanche is selling the house without her knowledge.\nHoping that she can also stage a comeback, Jane goes to a video store to see which of her old films are available on tape. Billy Korn, the store's owner, recognizes her as Baby Jane, much to her delight. Korn offers to manage her comeback and promises to arrange a spot in a talent show for $1,000. Jane agrees without realizing that he is a con artist only after her money.\nBack at home, Blanche tries to call her sister's psychiatrist, only to have Jane overhear the conversation and then physically attack her. Blanche tries to escape, but Jane locks her in her upstairs bedroom with no means of communication. After being starved for days, Blanche rummages through Jane's bedroom drawers for food and discovers that she has been forging her signature on checks to steal her money. Dominick arrives for his physical therapy session and discovers that Jane has bound and gagged her sister with duct tape. As he is attempting to cut her loose, Jane stabs Dominick to death with a pair of scissors and hides his body in the basement screening room.\nJane is shocked to learn that the \"talent show\" Korn arranged is actually a drag revue, complete with Korn himself dressed as Blanche. When they try to perform a duet from their childhood, the audience ridicules Jane's appearance and her poor singing voice, leading her to suffer a mental breakdown and be forced offstage. Korn drives to the mansion and finds Blanche, bound and gagged, near death. Jane stabs him to death with a broken trophy.\nJane puts Blanche in her car and drives to the beach, where their fondest memories took place during their childhood. Blanche admits she had been driving the car on the night of the accident but had allowed Jane to take the blame. She apologizes for never telling Jane the truth, and they are momentarily reconciled. The police arrive to find Blanche unconscious and near death. As they radio for help, Jane walks into the sea, attempting suicide before a police officer drags her out. The last shot is of Jane's smiling face as she goes willingly with the police.\n\nCast\nVanessa Redgrave as Blanche Hudson\nLynn Redgrave as Baby Jane Hudson\nBruce A.

Michael Flynn as Ray Hudson\nErinn Canavan as Young Blanche Hudson\nBeans Morocco as Drag Queen\nRoy Fegan as Police Officer\n\nDifferences from the novel\nBeing set during the 1990s as opposed to the 1960s in the original story, the film takes a modern overtone including Baby Jane being a film actress instead of a vaudevillian, and Blanche's use of the stairlift and cassette tape. Characters Elvira Stitt, the cleaning lady, and Edwin Flagg are replaced with Dominick, the physical therapist, and Billy Korn. The film also features scenes depicting the 1990s downtown district of Hollywood. Another change is Jane getting arrested at the end of the film.\n\nCritical reception\nIn a retrospective review, TV Guide awarded the film two stars, saying it \"fares admirably when compared with the well-remembered original\".", "answers": ["Godspell"], "incorrect_answer": "Madame Sin"}, {"input": "When they were formed, did The Fatima Mansions or Nude have more members?", "context": "Passage 1:\nThe Fatima Mansions\nThe Fatima Mansions were an Irish rock band formed in 1988 by Cork singer/keyboardist Cathal Coughlan, formerly of Microdisney.\n\nCareer\nThe original line-up consisted of Coughlan, Nick Allum, Jonathan Fell, Zac Woolhouse and Aindrias O'Gruama. They took their name from the Fatima Mansions corporation flats in Rialto, Dublin.The Fatima Mansions were a popular live band, and gained indie chart success with their albums Viva Dead Ponies, Bertie's Brochures, Valhalla Avenue and Lost in the Former West.\nThey entered the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart in 1992 with a heavily reworked version of Bryan Adams' song \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\", taken from an NME tribute album in aid of the charity, the Spastics Society. The single was a double A-side; the flip-track, Manic Street Preachers' version of \"Suicide Is Painless\" received most of the radio airplay.\nThey also gained mainstream exposure by opening a European leg of U2's Zoo TV Tour in 1992, although they were nearly booed off the stage and almost started a riot when front man Coughlan swore at a Milan audience and insulted the Pope. The band often courted controversy with religion, dictators, empires and general authority being targets for Coughlan's vitriol. Despite this, The Guardian newspaper described him as \"the most underrated lyricist in pop today\", and DJ John Peel said he could \"listen to Cathal Coughlan sing the phone book\".\nThe album and singles campaign for 1994's Lost in the Former West was styled on the glamour of Liberace, and featured a cover version of The Walker Brothers's \"Nite Flights\".\n\nDiscography\nSingles\n\"Only Losers Take the Bus\" (1989), Kitchenware\n\"Blues for Ceausescu\" (1990), Kitchenware\n\"Hive\" E.P.

Their second album The Clock Comes Down the Stairs reached number one in the UK Indie Chart. They developed cult followings in the Irish and UK indie music scenes before breaking up in 1988.\nCoughlan went on to lead the harder-edged The Fatima Mansions, who found critical success with their aggressive live shows and five consistent albums, but broke up in 1995.\nIn the following years Coughlan released intermittent solo material with musicians such as O\u2019Hagan, Jonathan Fell and Nick Allum. His solo career and reputation peaked in 2021 with the well received album Song of Co-Aklan (composed from the point of view of his alter ego \"Co Aklan\") which was released to critical acclaim fifteen years after his previous solo album Foburg (2006).\n\nCareer\nMicrodisney\nBorn in the village of Glounthaune, just outside of Cork city, Coughlan was active on the local Cork scene in the late 1970s, and after meeting Sean O'Hagan formed Microdisney as a duo in 1980. Following early local success, they moved to London, and recorded for the independent record label Rough Trade and, later and unsuccessfully, for the major label Virgin Records.His lyrics with Microdisney focus on politics, relationships and the interplay between the two, and incorporate surreal imagery and literary and historical references. His voice on these records has been compared to Scott Walker, whom Coughlan considered a major influence. They broke up in 1988, after which O'Hagan and Coughlan formed separate bands, the High Llamas and the Fatima Mansions.Microdisney reunited after three decades and performed together in London, Dublin and Cork in 2018 and 2019. In 2018, Coughlan and his bandmates received the IMRO/NCH Trailblazer Award, given to \"culturally important\" Irish albums (in this instance, for the 1985 album The Clock Comes Down The Stairs).\n\nThe Fatima Mansions\nCoughlan formed the Fatima Mansions in 1988, naming the band after the large public housing complex in the working class area of Rialto in Dublin's inner city. They became known for their aggressive music and song titles, including the early tracks \"Blues for Ceausescu\" and \"Bugs Fucking Bunny\". Their 1989 debut album was Against Nature followed by Viva Dead Ponies in 1990 and the 1991 EP Bertie's Brochures and the acclaimed albums Valhalla Avenue (1992) and Lost in the Former West (1994). Due to intra-band tension and contractual difficulties with Virgin Records, Fatima Mansions broke up in 1995.\n\nSolo work and collaborations\nContractual issues prevented Coughlan from performing in the aftermath of break up of the Fatima Mansions. His following album was released in August 2010 with the single Rancho Tetrahedron, credited to \"Cathal Coughlan and the Grand Necropolitan Quartet\". He later admitted that the supporting live performances were aggressive \"because there was just all this business nonsense going on and I wasn\u2019t able to perform new stuff in public at all because I was in certain contractual difficulties\". Reviewing the album, The Irish Times wrote that \"Coughlan's mixture of acerbity and dark lyricism is sustained on his fifth solo album, that there is a subtle Latin influence on the music, and Coughlan's Scott Walker inflected voice has never sounded better.\"He recorded with comedian Sean Hughes, High Llamas drummer Rob Allum (under the name of his alter-ego \"Cod\"), and Paul Jarvis of SLAB! as \"Bubonique\", releasing a number of CDs parodying current musical trends, including the albums 20 Golden Showers and Trance Arse Volume 3. He collaborated in 2011 with the British The Auteurs and Black Box Recorder vocalist Luke Haines on the song/speech show The North Sea Scrolls which premiering at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2011. The studio recording of The North Sea Scrolls was released on 19 November 2012.Coughlan's last album Song of Co-Aklan was completed at the end of 2019 in collaboration with Nick Allum, Aindrias O'Gruama, Jon Fell, Luke Haines, Audrey Riley, James Woodrow and Rhodri Marsden. It was preceded by the single \"Song of Co-Aklan\" and released in March 2021 on Dimple Discs. He formed the duo Telef\u00eds with US-based Irish producer and musician Jacknife Lee with whom he released the album A hAon in 2022. and a further release A D\u00f3  in October 2022.\n\nPersonal life\nCoughlan, survived by his wife, Julie, died aged 61 in hospital on 18 May 2022 after a long illness.\n\nDiscography\nMicrodisney\nKaught at the Kampus (compilation EP) \u2013 1980\nWe Hate You South African Bastards! \u2013 1984\nEverybody Is Fantastic (1984)\nThe Clock Comes Down the Stairs \u2013 1985, re-issued in 2013\nCrooked Mile \u2013 1986\n39 Minutes \u2013 1988\n\nFatima Mansions\nAgainst Nature \u2013 1989\nViva Dead Ponies \u2013 1990\nBertie's Brochures \u2013 (mini-album) 1991\nValhalla Avenue \u2013 1992\nLost in the Former West \u2013 1994\n\nSolo\nGrand Necropolitan \u2013 1996\nBlack River Falls \u2013 2000\nThe Sky's Awful Blue \u2013 2002\nFoburg \u2013 2006\nRancho Tetrahedron\u2013 2010\nSong of Co-Aklan - 2021\n\nTelef\u00eds\na hAon \u2013 2022\na D\u00f3 - 2022\n\nCitations\nGeneral sources\nMcDermott, Paul. \"Get That Monster Off the Stage\".

It was released in September 1989, receiving almost universal critical acclaim, described by NME as \"staggering in its weight of ideas...never loses its capacity to suddenly stun you\", and also described as \"a startlingly well-rounded debut\". A review from Allmusic stated \"Coughlan's lyrics are similarly aggressive throughout, with actions of overt and implicit violence in nearly every song and a grouchily misanthropic, almost nihilistic lyrical world-view throughout\".Against Nature reached #12 in the UK Indie Chart.This album would later be compiled with other pre-Viva Dead Ponies work of The Fatima Mansions on the 1992 Come Back My Children compilation album, while \"Only Losers Take The Bus\" would also feature on the American edition of Viva Dead Ponies.\n\nTrack listing\nAll tracks composed and arranged by Cathal Coughlan\n\n\"Only Losers Take the Bus\" (3:08)\n\"The Day I Lost Everything\" (4:16)\n\"Wilderness on Time\" (3:15)\n\"You Won't Get Me Home\" (3:01)\n\"13th Century Boy\" (4:00)\n\"Bishop of Babel\" (2:53)\n\"Valley of the Dead Cars\" (3:19)\n\"Big Madness/Monday Club Carol\" (4:38)\n\nPersonnel\nCathal Coughlan \u2013 vocals, keyboards, programming\nAndr\u00edas \u00d3 Gr\u00faama \u2013 guitar\nZac Woolhouse \u2013 keyboards\nJohn Fell \u2013 bass guitar\nNicholas Tiompan Allum \u2013 drums, windTechnicalBill Gill, Jamie Lane, Martin Harrison, Ralph Jezzard - engineer\nLawrence Bogle - cover illustration\nPassage 9:\nThe Back of the Pipes, Dublin\nThe Back of the Pipes was the name of a lane and pipe route in Dublin 8, Ireland, located between Dolphin's Barn and James's Walk. The lane replaced a branch of the Grand Canal which ultimately feed the Dublin city basin (now replaced with Basin Lane / Basin Street) and the Grand Canal Harbour. \nIt ran along the remote end of the back gardens of the houses on Rubens Street from the Dolphin's Barn end across from the Leinster Cinema, down the back of Fatima Mansions, on past the back gardens of the houses between Mallin Ave and Lourdes Road, past the \"stone sofa\" and finally came out at James's Walk across from the old iron footbridge.\nIt took its name from an important part of the Dublin water supply originally erected in the years following 1245.\n\nThe City Watercourse\nThe main water supply for the city of Dublin prior to the arrival of the Hiberno-Normans in the twelfth century was the river Poddle. The Liffey was tidal up to Islandbridge and thus undrinkable. Due to increased growth and development after their arrival it became imperative for the authorities to provide a greatly increased water supply. The monks of the Abbey of St. Thomas in 1242 diverted part of the River Dodder at Balrothery near Firhouse via a man-made channel to the River Poddle at Kimmage. This canal passed through Templeogue and joined the River Tymon, forming the Poddle. The flow was separated at Mount Argus, near Mount Jerome Cemetery, by a construction known as the Tongue, one third of the flow being allocated to the city basin or cistern. This part of the flow left the Poddle proper and proceeded to St. James Terrace in Dolphin's Barn. It advanced on to James's Walk on the summit of an elevated rampart of earth and stone which became known as the \"Back of the Pipes\" or the \"Ridges\", to a cistern near the present Waterworks Headquarters at Marrowbone Lane.\n\nHistory\nThis watercourse supplied the city for over five hundred years. It also supplied the mills of the Abbey of St. Thomas at Thomas Court, and was a source of bitter contention between the citizens and the Abbot; the latter eventually agreeing to pay \"yerly out of ther myllis without any contradiction, unto the Keper of the watyr of the cittie for the tyme beyng eyght busselis of corn, that ys to say four peckes of whet and four peckes of malt,\" for the use of the said water-course. In 1555 the Mayor of Dublin was given authority to keep the whole course from the Dodder to Dolphin's Barn. However disputes arose between the city authorities and the Earl of Meath, who controlled the Liberty of St. Thomas, so that in the 18th century it was the joint property of the city and the Earls of Meath.The ancient records of Dublin city have numerous references concerning the upkeep of these water works. One of the earliest is a request from King Henry III in 1245 for a supply of water for the King's Hall. The lead pipe which carried this supply was uncovered in Castle Street, next to Dublin Castle, in 1787, with an inscription from the 13th century. The rebel followers of Silken Thomas in 1534, according to Hollinshed's Chronicles, \"cut the pipes of the conduits whereby (the city) should be destitute of fresh water\".In 1721 the Corporation reconstructed and raised the level of the City Basin at St James Gate, in the final development of the Poddle supply.\nThe lane was taken into the surrounding properties but the rampart remains at the end of the gardens backing onto its former location.\n\nThe locality\nThe locality contained the Old Leinster Cinema (later the Dublin Ice Rink, now modern apartments) near Reuben Street and Emerald Square. Fatima Mansions and Lourdes Road backed on to the \"Pipes\". This part of the Grand Canal has been filled in and the Luas now runs along it. The visitors' centre at Guinness's brewery is a few minutes walk away from the other end of the \"Pipes\". \nThe Back of the Pipes was a popular meeting place for courting couples in the 19th century and much later into the 20th century. A place nearby where they would stroll was called the \"Stone Sofa\", located at St. James Walk.In Dublin slang \"at the back of the pipes\" became a response to an enquiry regarding the unknown whereabouts of an object or person.\nPassage 10:\nFatima Mansions (housing)\nFatima Mansions is an extensive public housing complex located in Rialto, Dublin. In the early 21st century, it underwent a substantial urban renewal programme with the assistance of public and private funding. All existing apartment blocks were demolished to make way for 600 accommodation units, consisting of social, affordable and private housing along with community, business and leisure facilities at a cost of \u20ac200 million. The blocks have since been renamed Herberton Apartments, but the area is still referred to locally as Fatima, which is the name of the adjacent Luas Red Line tram stop.\n\nHistory\nWork on the original complex started before World War II under the direction of Dublin Corporation (now Dublin City Council) but construction was held up due to material shortages. The first phase of construction was finally completed after the war and the first tenants began to move in during 1947: the development consisted of fifteen blocks, each of four floors in height. They replaced tenement housing for the area's working-class residents, and provided a great improvement in living conditions. In the mid 1980s the area became notorious for its high levels of heroin use and drug dealing, which eventually led to the original complex's demolition due to the drug problem's severity.The Fatima Mansions were an Irish art rock group named after the flats. Speaking in 2021, lead singer of the band Cathal Coughlan agreed that he had a \"pang of guilt\" for calling the band Fatima Mansions and said that the name of the band was \"emphatically not poking fun at poor social conditions that were being foisted upon people in inner-city Dublin\".", "answers": ["The Fatima Mansions"], "incorrect_answer": "Nude"}, {"input": "Micha\u0142 Wi\u015bniowiecki was related to the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Micha\u0142 Korybut Wi\u015bniowiecki in what way?", "context": "Passage 1:\nMicha\u0142 Wi\u015bniowiecki (1529\u20131584)\nMicha\u0142 Wi\u015bniowiecki or Mykhailo Vyshnevetsky (1529\u20131584) was a Ruthenian noble (szlachcic) of Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.

The Polish throne was vacant again, so another free election was necessary. As in 1669, the main candidates were French Duke Louis, Grand Conde, Philip William, Count Palatine of Neuburg (both supported by Louis XIV of France), and Charles V, Duke of Lorraine.\nHetman John Sobieski, who was a very influential figure in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, did not express interest in the Polish crown, and before the election stated that he did wish to be elected. Sobieski was hated by Lithuanian magnates of the Pac family, who in January 1674, during the Convocation Sejm, demanded that a bill prohibiting native Poles (or Piasts) from running in the election should be introduced.\nThe fact that the Pac family promoted such a bill means that Sobieski was regarded by many as a possible candidate. His name was mentioned by envoys of the House of Habsburg, and by French newspaper La Gazette. French diplomats later stated that Sobieski himself hesitated between running in the election, and supporting the Grand Conde.\nThe election began on Saturday, June 19, 1674. Despite the protests of Lithuanians, the Bishop of Krak\u00f3w Andrzej Trzebicki initiated the process, by singing the hymn Veni Sancte Spiritus. The next day, Sunday, June 20, was dedicated to religious ceremonies and behind the scenes negotiations. On Monday, June 21, the Bishop of Vilnius, Micha\u0142 Pac stated that Lithuania agreed to the Piast candidate.

After Michael's early death, these setbacks were reversed at the Battle of Khotyn in 1673 by his successor, John III Sobieski, who defeated an Austrian candidate in the election.In 1670 Michael I was married to Eleonora Maria of Austria (1653\u20131697), daughter of Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor, by his third wife Eleonora Gonzaga.\n\nBiography\nMichael was the son of Jeremi Wi\u015bniowiecki and his wife Gryzelda Konstancja Zamoyska. His parents likely met each other in September 1637 in Warsaw during the crowning of Cecilia Renata of Austria, the Queen of Poland and consort to W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV. They were engaged on 13 February 1638, over a month after the death of Gryzelda's father, Tomasz Zamoyski.\nThe wedding took place in Zamo\u015b\u0107 on 27 February 1639, and over a year later, on 31 May 1640, Michael Korybut was most likely born in the village of Bia\u0142y Kamie\u0144 as Micha\u0142 Tomasz Wi\u015bniowiecki. The infant was then taken to Zamo\u015b\u0107, where he spent first two years of his life under care of his grandmother Katarzyna Zamoyska (n\u00e9e Ostrogska). In 1642, Micha\u0142 was taken by his mother to Lubny. During the Khmelnytsky Uprising, he fled Left-bank Ukraine with his family and first settled in Wi\u015bniowiec in Volhynia, before arriving in Zamo\u015b\u0107 in autumn 1648.\n\nJeremi Wi\u015bniowiecki died in 1651, when most of his enormous estate remained under Cossack or Russian control. From 1651 \u2013 1655, young Micha\u0142 was under the care of  Karol Ferdynand Vasa, the bishop of Wroc\u0142aw and P\u0142ock. The boy stayed at the residence of the Bishops of P\u0142ock, in the town of Brok. After the death of Bishop Vasa on 9 May 1655, he was taken in by his wealthy uncle, Jan Zamoyski, Voivode of Sandomierz, who funded his education. Sometime in mid-1655, Micha\u0142 found himself at the court of King John II Casimir.\nFollowing the Swedish invasion of Poland, Michael, together with the royal court, fled to G\u0142og\u00f3wek in Upper Silesia. On 18 November 1655, following the request of the king, he went to Nysa, to study at the Jesuit College Carolinum and stayed there until March 1656.\nIn mid-1656, thanks to the support of Queen Marie Louise Gonzaga, Micha\u0142 Korybut began studying at Charles University in Prague. He returned to Poland in June 1660, but soon afterwards, headed to Dresden and Vienna to meet Empress Eleonora Gonzaga. There he saw his future wife Eleanor of Austria, who was a child at that time, for the first time. On this trip, Michael improved his knowledge of languages; he spoke Latin, German, Italian, French and also likely Tatar and Turkish as well.\nIn 1663, Michel took part in the Russo-Polish War, and during the Lubomirski Rebellion, he loyally supported the king.\n\nElection\nOn 16 September 1668, John II Casimir abdicated the Polish throne and left the country to live in France, making a new election necessary. The Bishop of Che\u0142mno, Andrzej Olszowski, suggested that Micha\u0142 Korybut should be listed as one of candidates for the throne. Wi\u015bniowiecki was supported by the Polish nobility, who sensed that a poor and inexperienced prince would not pose a threat to their rights enshrined in the Golden Liberty.\nThe Free election of 1669 took place in May and June of that year. Micha\u0142 Korybut Wi\u015bniowiecki was elected King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania on 19 June and became known as Michael I. Most of the gathered nobility voted for him as they wished to choose a native, Polish candidate (the so-called \"Piast\"), over foreign candidates. Wi\u015bniowiecki won 11,271 votes and was crowned on 29 September 1669 in Krak\u00f3w.\nHis election was immediately opposed by the pro-French camp, led by Primate of Poland Miko\u0142aj Prazmowski and Crown Hetman John Sobieski.\nOn 27 February 1670 Michael I married Austrian princess Eleanor, and the ceremony was celebrated by Papal Nuncio, Cardinal Galeazzo Marescotti, as Primate Prazmowski refused to attend. The reception took place at the Denhoff Palace in Kruszyna.\n\nInternal conflicts\nFollowing the 1669 election, the Commonwealth was divided between two camps \u2013 pro-French, and royal. The pro-French camp had several influential members, including Primate Prazmowski, Hetman Sobieski, Andrzej Morsztyn, Voivode of Krak\u00f3w Aleksander Micha\u0142 Lubomirski, Voivode of Ruthenia Stanis\u0142aw Jan Jab\u0142onowski, Voivode of Pozna\u0144 Krzysztof Grzymultowski, and Bishop of Krak\u00f3w Andrzej Trzebicki.\nIn November 1669, the French camp broke the Coronation Sejm, hoping to dethrone Michael and elect Count Charles-Paris d'Orl\u00e9ans-Longueville. In 1670, the internal struggle moved to the local sejmiks, during which the nobility demanded to bring a Sejm lawsuit against Hetman Sobieski. To defend their commander, Sobieski's soldiers formed a Confederation near Trembowla.\nTo make matters worse, the divided Commonwealth was under constant Turkish threat. In 1671, the king supported a rebellion of a unit of Stanis\u0142aw Wy\u017cycki, who, against the explicit order of Sobieski, abandoned Volhynia, leaving the province defenceless. King Michael ordered Wy\u017cycki and his men to spend the winter of 1671/72 in the wealthy starostwo of Sambor, and paid them their salaries, while Sobieski and his soldiers did not receive any money.\n\nIn 1672, the Ottoman Empire declared war on the Commonwealth, and the Polish\u2013Ottoman War of 1672\u201376 began. Despite this, the situation in the Polish Crown was still chaotic, with the danger of a civil war. The nobility formed a confederation near Go\u0142\u0105b, demanding the removal of Primate Prazmowski. Its members looted real estate owned by Hetman Sobieski and his family. On 22 November 1672 Lithuanian soldiers formed their own confederation in Kobry\u0144, declaring their support for the Go\u0142\u0105b confederation. In response, soldiers under Sobieski formed a confederation in Szczebrzeszyn. John Sobieski, together with his troops, headed to \u0141owicz, to meet Primate Prazmowski.\nNegotiations between the two factions were carried out by Papal Nuncio Francesco Buonvisi and Bishop of Krak\u00f3w Andrzej Trzebicki. Furthermore, Sultan Mehmed IV of the Ottoman Empire sent an offensive letter to Warsaw, demanding complete subordination of the Commonwealth. This greatly enraged the Poles but due to chaotic internal situation of the Commonwealth, both sides of the conflict reached an agreement in March 1672.\n\nWar with the Ottoman Empire\nIn June 1672, a 100,000-strong Ottoman army, under Mehmed IV, besieged the city of Kamieniec Podolski, which capitulated after 26 days. The invaders then approached Lw\u00f3w, which paid a ransom. Mounted Crimean Tatar units penetrated as far as Hrubiesz\u00f3w, Jas\u0142o and Biecz.\nIn October 1672, Hetman John Sobieski, upon request of the senators, tried to stop the invaders, defeating them in the Battle of Niemir\u00f3w, Battle of Komarno, and Battle of Petranka. Meanwhile, the Treaty of Buchach was signed on 18 October, in which the king ceded Podolia to the Ottomans and agreed to pay a yearly tribute. Under these terms, the once mighty Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was humbled by the Turks.\nSoon afterwards, Michael I began preparation for a new military campaign against the Ottomans. On 8 October 1673 at Skwarzawa near Z\u0142ocz\u00f3w, some 40,000 Polish soldiers concentrated, with 50 cannons. Due to poor health, the king handed the command of the army to Sobieski, and the Poles marched southwards, to Chocim.\n\nDeath, funeral, and legacy\nKing Michael I Korybut died in the Palace of the Archbishops of Lw\u00f3w, on 10 November 1673. His early demise seems to have been brought about by a severe case of food poisoning, although rumours persisted that he had been actually murdered by traitorous generals angered at the declining power of the Commonwealth.\nThe day after his death, John Sobieski won the  Battle of Chocim, which reversed some of the losses under Michael I's reign. On 19 May 1674 Hetman John Sobieski was elected the new monarch after the Free election of 1674.\nAfter the funeral, the heart of the king was buried at a Camedule Monastery in the Bielany district of Warsaw. The bowels were placed in a wall of the Latin Cathedral in Lw\u00f3w, while the body was buried in Wawel Cathedral in Krak\u00f3w on 31 January 1676, the same day that John Sobieski was crowned as John III.\nMichael's reign was considered to be less than successful as his ability to be a capable monarch were greatly hurt by Poland's quarrelling factions. His father's military fame notwithstanding, Michael lost the first phase of the Polish\u2013Ottoman War of 1672\u20131676.\n\nGallery\nRoyal titles\nOfficial Latin version: Michael I, Dei Gratia rex Poloniae, magnus dux Lithuaniae, Russiae, Prussiae, Masoviae, Samogitiae, Livoniae, Smolensciae, Kijoviae, Volhyniae, Podoliae, Podlachiae, Severiae, Czernichoviaeque, etc.(citation from one contemporary document: \"Michael primvs, Dei gratia rex Poloniae, magnus dvx Lituaniae, Russiae, Prussiae, Masouiae, Samogitiae, Kiiouiae, Volhyniae, Podlachiae, Podoliae, Liuoniae, Smolensciae, Seueriae Czernihouiaeque etc\")\n\nEnglish translation: Michael I, by the Grace of God, King of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania, Ruthenia, Prussia, Masovia, Samogitia, Livonia, Smolensk, Kiev, Volhynia, Podolia, Podlaskie, Severia and Chernihiv, etc.\n\nSee also\nHistory of Poland (1569\u20131795)\nWi\u015bniowiecki family\nPassage 9:\nZbigniew Firlej\nZbigniew Firlej (c. 1613\u20131649), of Lewart coat of arms, was a noble of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Using the crowdfunding model, the company based in Berlin, Germany aimed to create a direct link between private lenders and small businesses seeking loans. As of December 2014, Zencap had facilitated 5 million Euro in loans to small and medium-sized firms.In October 2015, the company was merged with Funding Circle, being active on UK and US.\n\nOrigin\nThe company, based in Berlin, was founded in March 2014 by Christian Grobe and Matthias Knecht, with support from Rocket Internet.\n\nLending\nThe business model resembled the US peer-to-peer lending platform Lending Club and UK-based company Funding Circle.\nZencap facilitated small business loans from 10,000 to 250,000 euros.  Zencap determined whether the borrower was creditworthy and assigned a credit grade that determined the payable interest rate and the fees. Zencap itself charged borrowers a 1% to 4.5% origination fee. The loan period ranged between 6 and 60 months while the loan could be repaid without an early repayment fee at any time. Conditions varied between countries.\nDer Tagesspiegel quoted founder Christian Grobe, \"We are very strict with the risk assessment.\" Once approved, businesses posted their loan request on the Zencap marketplace, where private lenders were able to choose which businesses they wanted to lend money to.\n\nFunding Circle acquisition of Zencap\nIn October 2015, Zencap was acquired by UK based Funding Circle, another lending platform in Europe. Zencap was active in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. The merge made Funding Circle one of the main peer to business lending leaders in Europe.\n\nSee also\nDebt-to-income ratio\nComparison of crowd funding services\nDisintermediation\nPassage 2:\nCommon pochard\nThe common pochard (; Aythya ferina) is a medium-sized diving duck. The scientific name is derived from Greek aithuia, an unidentified seabird mentioned by authors including Hesychius and Aristotle, and Latin  ferina, \"wild game\", from ferus, \"wild\".\n\nDescription\nThe adult male has a long dark bill with a grey band, a red head and neck, a black breast, red eyes and a grey back. The adult female has a brown head and body and a narrower grey bill-band. The triangular head shape is distinctive. Pochards are superficially similar to the closely related North American redhead and canvasback. Females give hoarse growls. Males have whistles cut off by a final nasal note aaoo-oo-haa.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nTheir breeding habitat consists of marshes and lakes with a metre or more water depth. Pochards breed in much of temperate and northern Europe and across the Palearctic. They are migratory, and spend winter in the south and west of Europe.In the British Isles, birds breed in eastern England and lowland Scotland, in small numbers in Northern Ireland with numbers increasing gradually, and sporadically in the Republic of Ireland, where it may also be increasing. While uncommon, individuals are also occasionally seen in the south of England, and small populations are sometimes observed on the River Thames. Large numbers stay overwinter in Great Britain, after the birds retreat from Russia and Scandinavia.\n\nEcology\nThese are gregarious birds, forming large flocks in winter, often mixed with other diving ducks such as the tufted duck.\nThese birds feed mainly by diving or dabbling. They eat aquatic plants with some molluscs, aquatic insects and small fish. They often feed at night, and will up-end for food as well as the more characteristic diving. According to the article 'Patterns in the diving behaviour of the pochard, Aythya ferina: a test of an optimality model' Pochard's have a behavioral preference when it comes to their feeding patterns. This behavioral preference is that Pochards prefer shallower water in comparison to deeper water even though the food concentration in deeper water may be higher.In a number of countries the population of Common Pochard is decreasing mainly due to urbanization of the natural habitats and their transformation, as well as due to overhunting.\nThe pochard is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.\n\nGallery\nPassage 3:\nBusiness Growth Fund\nBGF, established in 2011 as the Business Growth Fund, is an investment company that provides growth capital for small and mid-sized businesses in the UK and Ireland.From a network of 16 offices in the UK and Ireland, the company has invested more than \u00a33 billion in more than 400 small and mid-sized companies. Around three-quarters of its investments have been in companies based outside London and South East England.BGF typically takes minority, non-controlling shareholdings in investee companies. BGF has completed more than 150 exits by selling businesses in its portfolio.\n\nHistory\nBGF was founded in 2011 by Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered banks, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.The launch followed lobbying of both Conservative and Labour politicians by businessman Sir Nigel Rudd, who had argued for the creation of an organisation to provide equity funding to help close a perceived funding gap for small and mid-sized businesses. A shortfall in funding for small and mid-sized businesses in the UK had been identified as long ago as 1931 by the Macmillan Committee.BGF was seen as a successor to the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation (ICFC), set up by the Bank of England in 1945 and subsequently renamed 3i. BGF has been described as the \u201cmodern 3i\u201d.Stephen Welton, founding CEO, said that a new organisation was needed because 3i\u2019s business model, in line with the private equity industry generally, had evolved to focus on large buyout deals, meaning it had less of a focus on providing growth capital to small and mid-sized businesses.In 2017, BGF opened an office in Dublin to administer a \u20ac250 million fund to invest in small and mid-sized Irish companies. The Irish fund is backed by AIB, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and BGF\u2019s existing shareholders.BGF\u2019s model has been replicated in Canada with the Canadian Business Growth Fund, launched in 2018 and backed by financial institutions including Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Manulife. In 2019, the Australian Business Growth Fund was launched with backing from banks including Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, National Australia Bank and ANZ Bank.\n\nLeadership\nAndy Gregory has been chief executive officer of BGF since 1 September 2022. He took over from Stephen Welton, formerly of JP Morgan & Co, who led BGF since inception in 2011. From 1 January 2023, Welton will serve as non-executive chair of the business.In 2013, Welton was appointed as an adviser to the government regarding the establishment of the British Business Bank, and, in 2017, he was invited to join the Industry Panel for the UK Government\u2019s Patient Capital Review.\n\nInvestment approach\nBGF typically makes initial investments of between \u00a32-15 million, with the possibility for follow-on investments.The firm provides patient capital, which has been defined by HM Treasury as \u201clong-term investment in innovative firms led by ambitious entrepreneurs who want to build large-scale businesses\u201d.BGF typically invests as a minority, non-controlling shareholder. Investments are usually structured as ordinary shares, loan notes or a combination.When an investment is sold, the returns are reinvested in the fund. This model has been called an \u201cevergreen balance sheet\u201d.BGF invests in a range of companies including start-ups, growth-stage businesses and quoted companies across almost every region and sector of the UK and Irish economy, barring financial services.BGF has been recognised as the most active growth investor in the world by number of investments, averaging about one investment a week.\n\nNotable investments\nRecipe box delivery company Gousto first received funding from BGF in 2015. Gousto became a unicorn in 2020 when it completed a funding round valuing the business at more than $1 billion.\nSocial video advertising platform Unruly received financing from BGF in a funding round announced in 2012. The business was acquired by News Corp for \u00a358 million in 2015.\nM Squared, which develops lasers and photonic optical instruments, received funding from BGF in 2012. BGF exited the majority of its shareholding in the company in 2020 when the Scottish National Investment Bank became a shareholder.\n\nThe growth economy\nThe historian Sir Anthony Seldon has described the market segment of small and mid-sized companies in which BGF seeks to invest as \u201cthe growth economy\u201d. Research by PwC found there were 21,400 growth economy companies in the UK in 2018, defined as fast-growing businesses that report turnover of between \u00a32.5-100 million.BGF provides an alternative source of funding for these companies, which have traditionally relied on bank loans to finance growth.\nPassage 4:\nHardley Flood\nHardley Flood is a 49.8-hectare (123-acre) biological Site of Special Scientific Interest west of Great Yarmouth in Norfolk. It is part of the Broadland Ramsar site and Special Protection Area, and The Broads Special Area of Conservation.This area of tidal lagoons and reedbeds provides a spillway for the River Chet. The reedbeds provide nesting sites for birds, including nationally important populations of several breeding birds. Three rare flies have been recorded, Elachiptera uniseta, Elachiptera scrobiculata and Lonchoptera scutellata.The site is open to  the public.\nPassage 5:\nChina IPR SME Helpdesk\nThe China IPR SME Helpdesk is a project funded by the European Commission's Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry (DG ENTR). It provides European  small and medium-sized enterprises with free, practical support on Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in China. According to its website, The China IPR SME Helpdesk's mission is to \"support European Union (EU) small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to both protect and enforce their Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in or relating to China, through the provision of free information and services\".A pilot programme of The China IPR SME Helpdesk was established in 2008 under the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme and it was announced in January 2011 that the Helpdesk project has been extended for an additional three years (through the end of 2013).\nPassage 6:\nScathophaga\nThe genus Scathophaga are small to medium sized predatory flies that for the most part, have larvae that feed on other insect larva within animal dung or decaying vegetable matter. Many are highly variable, sometimes producing small, infertile males that superficially resemble females. This species is an example of an organism which may selectively store the sperm of multiple males, as females have three to four spermathecae.\n\nSpecies\nThese 99 species belong to the genus Scathophaga:\n\nData sources: i = ITIS, c = Catalogue of Life, g = GBIF, b = Bugguide.net\nPassage 7:\nPalmer Hay Flats State Game Refuge\nThe Palmer Hay Flats State Game Refuge is located in Alaska, south of Wasilla and north of Anchorage. It is composed of 28,800 acres (11,655 ha; 45 sq mi) of coastal marshy areas adjacent to Knik Arm that support populations of moose, muskrat, foxes, coyotes, eagles, and migratory waterfowl. In springtime, tens of thousands of migratory geese, swans, shoebirds, and ducks rest and refuel. Many of these stay in the summer. The Knik River, the Matanuska River, Rabbit Slough, Wasilla Creek, Cottonwood Creek, and Spring Creek flow through it.It is a popular location for hunting, skiing, iceskating, and hiking, and other uses.  It is bisected by the Glenn Highway.\nIt can be accessed at Rabbit Slough, from the Glenn Highway, Nelson Road, Scout Ridge and other locations.\n\nHistory\nAn indigenous people called the Knikatnu first settled the land that would become the Palmer Hay Flats State Game Refuge before Alaskan annexation into the United States. The indigenous people left behind a trail that would become the Iditarod Trail. Prior to the 1964 Alaska earthquake, the land was dry grassland. The name of the refuge stems from the hay farming that went on before the earthquake.\nPassage 8:\nGobizkorea\nThe GobizKOREA is operated by Korean SBC (Small & Medium Business Corporation), a non-profit, government-funded organization established to implement government policies and programs for the growth and development of Korean Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).

It rises in Poringland and flows eastwards through Alpington, Bergh Apton, Thurton and Loddon. At Loddon it passes under the A146 through Loddon Mill and into Loddon Staithe. From this point onwards the river is navigable. It then passes Hardley Flood to the north, a nature reserve part-managed by the Norfolk Wildlife Trust. The river finally joins the River Yare one mile west of Reedham at Hardley Cross, erected in 1676, which marks the ancient boundary between the City of Norwich and the Borough of Great Yarmouth. The total navigable length is some 3\u00bd miles.\n\nFishing\nFishing is permitted between Loddon and Hardley Cross, bream and roach being the most common catch.\n\nChurches\nA number of churches along the river are known as the \"Chet Valley Churches\". Most belong to the Church of England but they include the Church in Loddon, a combined Anglican and Methodist congregation.\nPassage 10:\nCha\u00f1aral Island\nIsla Cha\u00f1aral (sometimes referred to as Isla Chanaral or Chanaral Island) is located 6 km off-shore from the northern Central Chilean coast, some 100 km north of the city of La Serena. Together with Isla Choros and Isla Damas, the island forms the Humboldt Penguin National Reserve, which is administered by the Chilean Forestry Corporation. All three islands support populations of Humboldt penguins, but are also habitat for several other rare and endangered animal species such as the Peruvian diving petrel or the South American marine otter. In recent years the reserve has experienced a strong increase in tourist activities, mainly due to being an important feeding ground in the summer months of different marine mammal species like fin whales, blue whales, humpback whales, and bottlenose dolphins that reside in the waters of the reserve. The local fishermen formed an association in cooperation with the National Tourism Service Sernatur to conduct whale watching activities in a sustainable manner, implementing responsible whale watching guidelines.\nIsla Cha\u00f1aral is the biggest of the reserve's islands. Access to the island restricted by permit only. The island consists of two plateau levels. The main plateau between 50 and 70 meters above sea level is divided into a western and an eastern part by a second high plateau (>100 m). The vegetation of the plateaus differs considerably. While the main plateau is dominated by shrub and cacti the high plateau has a barren appearance with only few small cactus aggregations.\n\nExternal links and references\nChanaral Island: the biggest Humboldt Penguin Colony in the world\nThe Humboldt Penguin Colonies at Chanaral Island, Chile\nHumboldt penguins from the International Penguin Conservation Web Site", "answers": ["duck"], "incorrect_answer": "goose"}, {"input": "Clone of clones played alongside a band from where?

He also performed guest guitar spots on several Minutemen tracks and played alongside Black Flag's Greg Ginn and Chuck Dukowski in the SST all-star jam band October Faction, recording two albums with them. Baiza was also part of the musical side project Nastassya Filippovna which featured Bob Lee (drums), Devin Sarno (bass) and Mike Watt (bass). He substituted for Nels Cline during Mike Watt's European and American tours behind his second solo album, Contemplating the Engine Room, in 1997 and 1998. Also in 1997, he and Cline played (sometimes together) in the band Solo Career with Lee (drums), Richard Derrick (bass), Walter Zooi (trumpet) and Gustavo Aguilar (percussion); other guitarists in that rotating ensemble included Mario Lalli, Woody Aplanalp and Ken Rosser. Currently, he is in the reunited Saccharine Trust as well as the improvisational unit Unknown Instructors with former Minutemen Mike Watt and George Hurley.\n\nArtwork\nBaiza is also an accomplished visual artist. In 1983 he illustrated the cover of the Minutemen's record Buzz or Howl Under the Influence of Heat. The illustration depicts the faces of D. Boon and Mike Watt engaged in heated dialogue as they so often did as friends and musical collaborators.In late 2013 The Cornelius Projects in San Pedro hosted The Mind of Joe Baiza - Paintings, Drawings, Photographs & Artifacts.\n\nDiscography\nSaccharine TrustPaganicons (1981, SST) [EP]\nSurviving You, Always (1984, SST)\nWorldbroken (1985, SST)\nWe Became Snakes (1986, SST)\nPast Lives (1989, SST)\nThe Great One Is Dead (2001, Hazelwood)Universal Congress OfJoe Baiza & The Universal Congress Of (1987, SST)\nThis Is Mecolodics (1988, SST) [EP]\nProsperous and Qualified (1988, SST)\nThe Sad and Tragic Demise of Big Fine Hot Salty Black Wind (1991, Enemy)\nThe Eleventh-Hour Shine-On (1992, Enemy)\nSparkling Fresh (1998, Hazelwood)MecolodiacsMecolodiacs (1994, Enemy Records)PuttanescaPuttanesca (2006, Catasonic Records)Unknown InstructorsThe Way Things Work (2005, Smog Veil Records)\nThe Master's Voice (2007, Smog Veil Records)\nFunland (2009, Smog Veil Records)with Mike WattContemplating the Engine Room: Live in Long Beach \u201898 \u2013 Five Man Opera SoloPrelude to Peace (2017, MINUS ZERO Recordings)\nTwo Duos with Jason Kahn and Felix Gebhard (2018, Hangover Central Station)Guest appearancesWhat Makes a Man Start Fires? by Minutemen, songs \"Beacon Sighted Through Fog\" and \"East Wind/Faith\" (1983, SST)\nThe Politics of Time by Minutemen, song \"Tune For Wind God\" (1984, New Alliance Records)\nDouble Nickels on the Dime by Minutemen, song \"Take 5, D.\" (1984, SST)\nBall-Hog or Tugboat? by Mike Watt, songs \"Drove Up From Pedro\" and \"Intense Song for Madonna to Sing\"  (1995, Columbia Records)\nOur Band Could Be Your Life: A Tribute to D Boon and the Minutemen, song \"9:30 May 2\" (1996, Little Brother Records)\n1979 by The Reactionaries, song \"Innuendo\" (2010, Water Under The Bridge Records)\nMOOF by Double Naught Spy Car, song \"Hairsuit\" (2016)\nPassage 5:\nSomeKindaWonderful\nSomeKindaWonderful is an American rock band from Cleveland, Ohio, consisting of Jordy Towers on vocals, Sw1tched singer Ben Schigel on drums, Justin Andres on bass and keys and Sarah Dryer on percussion and vocals. Towers, a singer-songwriter formerly signed to Interscope Records, formed the band in January 2013 during a visit to Olmsted Falls, Ohio after meeting and befriending local musicians Matthew Gibson and Schigel at a bar, eventually heading to a studio and recording the song \"Reverse\".The band later signed to Downtown Records and released their self-titled debut studio album on June 16, 2014. \"Reverse\" (written the night they met in a bar just outside of Cleveland Ohio) was released as their debut single and garnered initial support from Los Angeles modern rock station KROQ, eventually peaking at number 1 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. The band went on a US tour supporting New Politics and Bad Suns in Fall 2014. Spring 2015 they did a US Headlining tour, \"Burn It Up Tour,\" supported by Marc Scibilia. Following all of this, each of the members, except Jordy Towers (Lead Singer), decided to retire from the touring life to start families.\nIn 2016, Towers decided to start creating new SomeKindaWonderful music. SKW was his brain child and did not want to give it up since the success of \"Reverse\" kept fans wondering where SKW had gone. In July of the same year, Towers connected with German producer Nikolai Potthoff and started creating a new sound for SKW. Towers says, \"I think Nikolai and I have captured the natural progression of where SKW should be. As we all know the musical landscape changes so rapidly and I think we've created some timeless records here and have changed with the times nicely\".The EP is forthcoming. The lead single, released in July 2017, is titled \"Wheels Up\" and featured rapper Casey Veggies. Towers says, \"the track is a bass heavy alt soul song we wrote in 10 minutes one night on sleep deprivation and weed.\"Towers came into music as a rapper.

Their debut album, Ministry of Love, was released in 2013 on Iamsound in the US. Previously, the band released \"While You Were Sleeping\" single in 2010 and a self-titled EP in 2012 on the same label. Io Echo's style combines rock music compositions with instruments such as a Japanese koto harp and Chinese violins. Io Echo were hand-picked by Trent Reznor to open for Nine Inch Nails at the last show of their Wave Goodbye Tour. Io Echo have also recently composed the score to the Harmony Korine and James Franco film project Rebel.  In 2013, the band played Coachella, Lollapalooza, and toured with Bloc Party and Garbage.  As well as recording and touring, after seeing them perform live Jeffrey Deitch asked the band to curate an audio visual festival at the Museum of Modern Art Los Angeles. Io Echo named it PLAY MOCA and played alongside Salem, Cults, Zola Jesus, Active Child, and more.Gika and Ross were introduced by a friend and bonded over a mutual love for The Velvet Underground, in particular the song \u201cVenus in Furs\u201d. They released the EP Io Echo in October 2012. While working on their debut album, the band opened for The Big Pink, Florence + the Machine, The Drums, Nine Inch Nails, and Garbage.

On their debut EP, the band worked with producer Justin Long (U.S. Royalty).  They have played shows alongside bands such as Sam Roberts Band, The Trews, SomeKindaWonderful, and Saintseneca.\n\nHistory\nFormation and influences\nIn the summer of 2012, after their former band The Blue Line dissolved, Payes, Scialli, and then-guitarist Dave Chaletzky recruited drummer Brian Abbott to start a new musical project.  The name \"Clones of Clones\" was conceived as an ironic play on words; Payes has stated that they have always strived for \"uniqueness with a hint of familiarity.\"  The band recorded the \"Neighborhoods\" EP and began playing shows to support its release.In early 2013, Chaletzky left the band and was replaced by Todd Evans of Florida's A New Way To Live Forever, completing the current line-up.\n\nName meaning\nThe band name Clones of Clones was conceived as a way of expressing frustration with the artistic cycle of copying and reproducing pre-existing ideas at the expense of risk-taking novelty. According to Payes, \"Nothing is completely original...I\u2019m not sure things have been original for awhile. I envision a clone to be a less perfect version of its former self.\u201d\n\n\"Neighborhoods\" EP (2013)\nShortly after forming in Summer 2012, Clones of Clones recorded the \"Neighborhoods\" EP with Justin Long (U.S. Royalty) in Potomac, MD.  The EP was released in early 2013 with the following track listing:\nThe Neighborhood\nBully\nHomie\nTake Care of Yourself\n\n\"Mr. Sanity\" single (2013)\nThe band continued its work with Justin Long in 2013, recording the single \"Mr. Sanity.\"  This was the first material recorded with Evans in the band.\n\nI Don't Need Your Love (2014)\nThe title track \"I Don't Need Your Love\" was released along with \"Out Loud\" and \"The Battle Between\" on November 11, 2014.\n\nBand members\nBen Payes - Guitar, synth, vocals\nTodd Evans - Guitar, synth, vocals\nNick Scialli - Bass, guitar, vocals\nBrian Abbott - Drums\n\nFormer members\nDave Chaletzky - Guitar, vocals\n\nDiscography\n\"Neighborhoods\" EP (2013)\n\"Mr. Sanity\" Single (2013)\n\"I Don't Need Your Love\" Single (2014)\n\"Monster Heart\" Album (2015)\n\u201cThat Wasn\u2019t Me\u201d EP (2017)\n\nSingles\nNotable performances\nSince releasing their \"Neighborhoods\" EP, Clones of Clones has toured in Washington, D.C. and nearby mid-atlantic states.  The band has played four shows in Washington, D.C. opening for nationally and internationally touring acts.\nPassage 10:\nI, Human\nI, Human is the second full-length album by Singaporean death metal band, Deus Ex Machina, and the first to feature a permanent vocalist, giving it more uniformity in contrast to The War Inside, which had a different singer for each track. Musically, it is an edgy mixture of thrash metal, melodic death metal and progressive metal interjections, coupled with a diversified vocal approach. The lyrical content of the album deals with the future: Cloning. Specifically, questions regarding its use, legality, implications and the possibility of a world full of clones fighting to gain their own identity. The concept is based on Isaac Asimov's novel I,Robot, but also is influenced by other science fiction works such as Blade Runner, The 6th Day, A.I. Artificial Intelligence, and Warhammer 40,000. Each songs discusses the ethical issues pertaining to cloning, shifting from first person to second person to third person perspective. The band further divulges the mind frame of an unnamed clone character as it gradually realizes it is a clone, upon awaking from what it thought was a dream. In their pursuit of equality and acceptance, the band delves deep into their thoughts, fears, and plans, channeling these emotions into a powerful auditory experience accompanied by thought-provoking lyrics.\n\nTrack listing\nM(n)emo(nic)ries \u2013 1:58\nThe Mask \u2013 3:42\nReplicant \u2013 5:47\nJigsaw \u2013 4:52\nThe Human Strain \u2013 2:45\nI \u2013 5:19\nThe Omega Directive \u2013 3:53\nAssent / Dissent \u2013 5:30\nHidden Track \u2013 3:08\n\nPersonnel\nRyan Prashant Joseph \u2013 guitar\nShailendra Singh \u2013 drums\nMithun MK \u2013 lead vocals\nCaspar Francis \u2013 bass", "answers": ["Cleveland, Ohio"], "incorrect_answer": "Detroit, Michigan"}, {"input": "Which genus has more species, Quesnelia or Honeysuckle?", "context": "Passage 1:\nQuesnelia strobilispica\nQuesnelia blanda is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae, endemic to southeastern Brazil. It was first described in 1856 as Bromelia blanda. As of November 2022, the Encyclopaedia of Bromeliads listed it under the synonym Quesnelia strobilospica, which it spelt Quesnelia strobilispica.\nPassage 2:\nHoneysuckle\nHoneysuckles are arching shrubs or twining vines in the genus Lonicera () of the family Caprifoliaceae, native to northern latitudes in North America and Eurasia. Approximately 180 species of honeysuckle have been identified in both continents. Widely known species include Lonicera periclymenum (common honeysuckle or woodbine), Lonicera japonica (Japanese honeysuckle, white honeysuckle, or Chinese honeysuckle) and Lonicera sempervirens (coral honeysuckle, trumpet honeysuckle, or woodbine honeysuckle). L. japonica is a highly invasive species considered a significant pest in parts of North America, Europe, South America, Australia, and Africa.Some species are highly fragrant and colorful, so are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. In North America, hummingbirds are attracted to the flowers, especially L. sempervirens and L. ciliosa (orange honeysuckle). Honeysuckle derives its name from the edible sweet nectar obtainable from its tubular flowers. The name Lonicera stems from Adam Lonicer, a Renaissance botanist.\n\nDescription\nMost species of Lonicera are hardy twining climbers, with a minority of shrubby habit. Some species (including Lonicera hildebrandiana from the Himalayan foothills and L. etrusca from the Mediterranean) are tender and can only be grown outside in subtropical zones. The leaves are opposite, simple oval, 1\u201310 cm (0.39\u20133.94 in) long; most are deciduous but some are evergreen.\nMany of the species have sweetly scented, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that produce a sweet, edible nectar, and most flowers are borne in clusters of two (leading to the common name of \"twinberry\" for certain North American species). Both shrubby and vining sorts have strongly fibrous stems which have been used for binding and textiles.\nThe fruit is a red, blue or black spherical or elongated berry containing several seeds; in most species the berries are mildly poisonous, but in a few (notably Lonicera caerulea) they are edible and grown for home use and commerce. Most honeysuckle berries are attractive to wildlife, which has led to species such as L. japonica and L. maackii spreading invasively outside of their home ranges. Many species of Lonicera are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species\u2014see a list of Lepidoptera that feed on honeysuckles.\n\nInvasive species\nThe spread of L. japonica in North America began in the United States in 1806, and it was widely cultivated by the 1860s. It was first discovered in Canada in Ontario forests in 1976, and became invasive by 2007. L. japonica was introduced in Australia between 1820 and 1840.Several species of honeysuckle have become invasive when introduced outside their native range, particularly in North America, Europe, South America, Australia, and Africa.  Invasive species include L. japonica, L. maackii, L. morrowii, L. tatarica, and the hybrid between the last two, L. \u00d7 bella.\n\nCultivation\nHoneysuckles are valued as garden plants, for their ability to cover unsightly walls and outbuildings, their profuse tubular flowers in early summer, and the intense fragrance of many varieties. The hardy climbing types need their roots in shade, and their flowering tops in sunlight or very light shade. Varieties need to be chosen with care, as they can become substantial. Cultivars of the dense, small-leaved L. nitida are used as low, narrow hedges.The following hybrids have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:\n\nOther cultivars are dealt with under their species names.\nThe honeysuckle species L. japonica is grown as a commercial crop for traditional Chinese medicine use.\n\nPhytochemicals and sensory effects\nHoneysuckle is renowned for its colorful, fragrant flowers and variously colored fruit, indicating the presence of complex phytochemicals underlying these properties. Component analyses of berries from 27 different cultivars and 3 genotypes of edible honeysuckle (Lonicera caerulea var. kamtschatica) showed the presence of iridoids, anthocyanins, flavonols, flavanonols, flavones, flavan-3-ols, and phenolic acids. While sugars determine the level of sweetness in the berries, organic acids and polyphenols are responsible for the sour taste and tartness. Some 51 of the same compounds in berries are found in flowers, although the proportions of these compounds varied among cultivars studied.\n\nInteraction with other species\nMany insects in the order Lepidoptera visit honeysuckles as a food source. An example of this is the moth Deilephila elpenor. This nocturnal species of moth is especially attracted to honeysuckles, and they visit the flowers at night to feed on their nectar.\n\nSelected species\nSome 180 species of Lonicera are documented.\nSeveral fossil species are known from the Miocene of Asia.\nPassage 3:\nQuesnelia dubia\nQuesnelia dubia is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae, endemic to Brazil (the state of Bahia).

It is native to parts of Europe, and naturalised in South East Britain and northeastern North America.  It can readily be distinguished from Europe's most common species, Lonicera periclymenum, by its topmost leaves, which are perfoliate as the Latin name suggests (that is, the stem appears to grow through the centre of the leaf). It is a vigorous, deciduous climber growing up to 8 metres.  It bears masses of very fragrant, cream-coloured flowers, tinged with pink, appearing in midsummer.", "answers": ["Honeysuckle"], "incorrect_answer": "Quesnelia"}, {"input": "The publication of which magazine ended first, Right On! or Castle of Frankenstein?", "context": "Passage 1:\nThe Pitchfork Review\nThe Pitchfork Review was an American quarterly music magazine, available in print only, that included long-form feature stories, photography, and illustrations, and also included selected recent pieces from Pitchfork's online content. The magazine ended after 11 issues in November 2016.\n\nLaunch\nIn December 2013, Pitchfork Media debuted The Pitchfork Review, a quarterly print journal focused on long-form music writing and design-focused content. J.C. Gabel, its first editor, had been the publisher of The Chicagoan and founding publisher of Stop Smiling.According to the New York Times, Pitchfork Media planned a limited-edition quarterly publication of about 10,000 copies of each issue, perfect bound, and printed on glossy, high-quality 8-by-10\u00bc paper. It was expected that about two-thirds of the content would be original, with the remaining one-third recycled from the Pitchfork website.\nCovering the launch, the International Business Times likened the publication's literary aspirations to The New Yorker and Paris Review, and editorialized: But as impressive as it is, is it a step back in time for a brand more known for looking ahead? Perhaps, but that doesn't mean it's a step backwards; rather, it can be seen as a show of confidence. And there is reason to believe it could turn a profit. Print still has a currency, in terms of perception and ad revenue, and a well-produced print glossy can still resonate with readers in a way that pixels can't.\nThe Hollywood Reporter quoted the magazine's creative director as saying that moving into print was \"not a nostalgic move, because print has never left our lives,\" adding that Pitchfork's goal was to \"create a permanent object of a moment through music journalism and documentation... a compendium of what we'll remember from the last few months and what's going through our minds as music fans right now.\"Converse was secured as an exclusive advertising partner for the first four issues, and agreed to sponsor a series of 7-inch records included with the 2014 issues of the publication, beginning with No. 2.\n\nIssues\n2013\u20132014 issues\nNo. 1 (Winter 2013)\nThe inaugural issue of The Pitchfork Review included original articles about Van Morrison, Otis Redding, Glenn Danzig, and the history of the jukebox, as well as a retrospective on the glory days of the U.K. weekly music press.\n\nNo. 2 (Spring 2014)\nAmong its original pieces, the second issue included a feature article by Franklin Bruno about Game Theory's frontman and songwriter Scott Miller, who died in 2013.

The publication was started by Wallace Thurman, Zora Neale Hurston, Aaron Douglas, John P. Davis, Richard Bruce Nugent, Gwendolyn Bennett, Lewis Grandison Alexander, Countee Cullen, and Langston Hughes. \nThe magazine's title referred to burning up old ideas, and Fire!! challenged the norms of the older Black generation while featuring younger authors. The publishers promoted a realistic style, with vernacular language and controversial topics such as homosexuality and prostitution. Many readers were offended, and some Black leaders denounced the magazine.   \nThe endeavor was plagued by debt, and its quarters burned down, ending the magazine after just one issue.\n\nHistory\nFire!! was conceived to express the African-American experience during the Harlem Renaissance in a modern and realistic fashion, using literature as a vehicle of enlightenment. The magazine's founders wanted to express the changing attitudes of younger African Americans. In Fire!! they explored controversial issues in the Black community, such as homosexuality, bisexuality, interracial relationships, promiscuity, prostitution, and color prejudice.Langston Hughes wrote that the name was intended to symbolize their goal \"to burn up a lot of the old, dead conventional Negro-white ideas of the past ... into a realization of the existence of the younger Negro writers and artists, and provide us with an outlet for publication not available in the limited pages of the small Negro magazines then existing.\" The magazine's headquarters burned to the ground shortly after it published its first issue, ending its operations.\n\nReception\nFire!! was plagued by debt and encountered poor sales. It was not well received by the Black public because some felt that the journal did not represent the sophisticated self-image of Blacks in Harlem. Other readers found it offensive for many reasons, and it was denounced by Black leaders such as the Talented Tenth, \"who viewed the effort as decadent and vulgar\". They disapproved of content relating to prostitution and homosexuality, which they considered degrading to \"the race.\" They also thought many pieces published were a throw-back to old stereotypes, as they were written in the slang and language of the southern vernacular. They felt the \"undignified\" contents reflected poorly on the Black race. As an example, the critic at the Baltimore Afro-American wrote that he \"just tossed the first issue of Fire!! into the fire\".But, The Bookman applauded the journal's unique qualities and its personality. Although this magazine had only one issue, \"this single issue of Fire!! is considered an event of historical importance.\"\n\nFeatures\nThe magazine covered a variety of literary genres: it includes a novella, an essay, stories, plays, drawings and illustrations, and poetry.\n\nRepresentation in other media\nThe story of the rise and fall of Fire!! is showcased in the 2004 movie Brother to Brother. It features a gay African-American college student named Perry Williams. he befriends an elderly gay African American named Bruce Nugent. Williams learns that Nugent was a writer and co-founder of Fire!!, and associated with other notable writers and artists of the Harlem Renaissance.\n\"Fire!!\" is heavily mentioned in the play \nFIRE! written by Jenifer Nii. The play premiered in 2010 at Salt Lake City, Utah's Plan B Theatre Company. \nThe 45 minute play, with one actor playing Wallace Thurman, covers the man's life, with a focus on the production of \"Fire!!\" and the writing he did following it. The play is performing for the last time and touring schools in the process; to teach Utahn students about Wallace Thurman, who is rarely taught off in the schooling system of his native state; as of April 2023.\nPassage 4:\nCastle of Frankenstein\nCastle of Frankenstein was an American horror, science fiction and fantasy film magazine, published between 1962 and 1975 by Calvin Thomas Beck's Gothic Castle Publishing Company, distributed by Kable News. Larry Ivie\u2014who also was cover artist for several early issues\u2014and Ken Beale edited the first three issues. Writer-artist Bhob Stewart edited the magazine from 1963 into the early 1970s. Although promoted and sold as a \"monster magazine,\" readers were aware that Castle of Frankenstein, at the time, was the only nationally distributed magazine devoted to a legitimate and serious coverage of B movies. In addition to its central focus on classic and current horror films, Castle of Frankenstein also devoted pages to amateur filmmakers and fanzines. Its advertising pages sold full-length silent feature films such as The Lost World and The Golem: How He Came into the World.\nFollowing employment as an editor for publisher Joe Weider, Calvin Beck (1929\u20131989) entered the monster magazine arena in 1959 with his one-shot issue Journal of Frankenstein, which featured John Zacherle on the cover and had a small circulation. As an experiment, Beck printed part of the run on slick paper. After a hiatus and a title change, Beck returned with Castle of Frankenstein #1 in 1962.\nBeck claimed that since his magazine carried no outside advertising, a standardized schedule was unneeded. Issues were published whenever they were completed, leading to an erratic, irregular schedule. Distribution also varied; while many well-stocked periodical outlets did not carry the magazine, some less-likely outlets (such as grocery stores) did.\nThe magazine ran 25 issues, plus one annual (the 1967 Fearbook); the final issue was published in 1975. Beck cancelled his magazine not because of poor sales, but to devote his energy to writing books. During its primary run, Castle of Frankenstein outlasted the majority of monster magazines that filled the market for two decades, with the notable exception of Famous Monsters of Filmland.\nIn 1999, publisher Dennis Druktenis revived both Castle of Frankenstein (releasing 10 more issues) and the original title Journal of Frankenstein (releasing five more issues).\nIn 2021, publishers Don and Vicki Smeraldi once again revived \"Castle of Frankenstein,\" issuing #36 in October, with plans to release new issues twice a year every spring and fall.\n\nContributors\nIn addition to book reviews by Charles Collins and Lin Carter, contributors included Barry Brown, Richard A. Lupoff and William K. Everson.\nInspired by the ratings and reviews of films in Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma, Stewart introduced a similar system with the \"Comic Book Council\", the first critical coverage of comic books to appear in a national magazine. Commentary and ratings of underground comics were juxtaposed with reviews of mainstream comics. Another key feature was the \"Frankenstein Movieguide\", an attempt to document all fantastic films seen on television with \"mini-reviews\" written by Joe Dante and Stewart. Unlike some genre commentators, these reviewers were not limited only to monster-style films. Instead, the many brief, tightly-written fantasy film reviews also covered experimental and foreign art films. The capsule review format enforced a brevity and economy that inspired many younger writers.\nWith new art and reprints of vintage fantasy art, the magazine published such artists as Aubrey Beardsley, Hannes Bok, Harry Clarke, Virgil Finlay, Jim Steranko, Wally Wood and Weird Tales illustrator Matt Fox. To cut costs, color photos rather than paintings were used on the covers of issues six through 14. With issue 11's cover photo of Leonard Nimoy, Castle of Frankenstein was the first magazine to feature Star Trek as a major cover story. Other issues displayed cover paintings by Robert Adragna, Marcus Boas, Bok, Frank Brunner, Maelo Cintron, Larry Ivie, Russ Jones, Ken Kelly, Los Angeles painter Tom Maher and Lee Wanagiel.\nInterior art included graphic stories by Ivie, Brunner, Bernie Wrightson and the team of Marv Wolfman and Len Wein, plus the first published comics page by Marvel artist-writer-editor Larry Hama. Castle of Frankenstein also carried an unusual original comic strip, Baron von Bungle by Richard Bojarski, which gave a humorous twist to the world depicted in Universal horror films.\n\nBooks\nBeck, with an editorial assist by fantasy fiction scholar Haywood P. Norton, assembled the paperback anthology, The Frankenstein Reader (Ballantine Books, 1962). The two brought together a roster of vintage horror-fantasy tales by E. F. Benson, Ambrose Bierce, Robert W. Chambers, Ralph Adams Cram, Charles Dickens, Amelia B. Edwards, Katharine Fullerton Gerould, Richard Middleton, Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, Robert Louis Stevenson and H. G. Wells.\nIn Heroes of the Horrors (Macmillan, 1975), Beck wrote illustrated biographies of six leading horror film stars (Lon Chaney Sr., Lon Chaney Jr., Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre, Bela Lugosi, Vincent Price) and writers such as Robert Bloch and Richard Matheson. The book reworked information previously unearthed for Castle of Frankenstein articles.\nBhob Stewart and Beck then collaborated on a companion volume, Scream Queens: Heroines of the Horrors (Macmillan, 1978), illustrated biographical profiles of 29 fantasy film actresses and directors. The book included an article by actor Barry Brown, plus research by Drew Simels, author of the TV movie entries in early editions of Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide series. With articles on Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Veronica Lake, Elsa Lanchester, Agnes Moorehead, Mary Philbin, Barbara Steele, Vampira, Fay Wray and others, Scream Queens also incorporated material from the Castle of Frankenstein files of manuscripts and still photographs.\nBeck's fourth book, Sense of Wonder, about fantasy films of the 1940s, was never published.\n\nSee also\nScience fiction magazine\nFantasy fiction magazine\nHorror fiction magazine\nPassage 5:\nNyl\u00e6nde\nNyl\u00e6nde (Norwegian: New Frontiers) was a Norwegian political and cultural magazine that focused on women's rights.

KoreAm was the most widely circulated, longest-running, independent English-language publication serving the Korean American community.\nTwo years after KoreAm's founding, the magazine became a major forum for the Korean community relating to the 1992 Los Angeles riots. The riots caused violence, arson, looting and lawlessness. Korean-run businesses were targeted during what has been dubbed this nation's first \"multiethnic riot.\"KoreAm featured prominent Korean Americans on its cover. These stories included Margaret Cho, John Cho, Daniel Dae Kim, Jane Kim, and Michelle Rhee. Stories also included a profile on Pinkberry founder Shelly Hwang, a ground level feature on the Virginia Tech massacre, as well as packages on health care reform, education reform, gays in the military, and Korean Americans affected by Hurricane Katrina. \nIn 2003, KoreAm launched a sister publication, Audrey Magazine. \nThe magazine's official website was launched in 2009.London Trust Media acquired the magazine in 2014.

Taylor is best known for his comedic directorial work with Harold Lloyd and Mary Pickford, and also later worked with Laurel and Hardy. He was born in New York City.\nA notorious cinematic legend over the decades has suggested that Taylor's 1929 adaptation of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew had the screen credit \"additional dialogue by Sam Taylor\".  However, no extant prints of the film contain this credit, and there is no documentary evidence that it ever existed.\nTaylor directed seven feature films with Lloyd as star, second only to Fred C. Newmeyer (the two co-directed Lloyd in five features). He also directed Pickford in her first \"talkie\" feature with Coquette (1929), which garnered the latter an Academy Award. \nTaylor died at the age of 62 in Santa Monica, California.\n\nPartial filmography\nExternal links\n Media related to Sam Taylor (director) at Wikimedia Commons\n Works by or about Sam Taylor at Wikisource\nSam Taylor at IMDb\nPassage 2:\nLord Cardross\nLord Cardross is a title in the Peerage of Scotland, since 1695 a subsidiary title of the earldom of Buchan. It was created in 1606 for John Erskine, Earl of Mar, with remainder to his heirs male and assignees whatsoever and with the power to nominate his successor. In 1617 he nominated his second son by his second wife Marie Stewart, Henry Erskine, Master of Cardross, to be his successor in the lordship of Cardross. The Earl of Mar died in 1634 and was succeeded in the earldom of Mar by his son by his first wife, John, and in the lordship of Cardross by his grandson David Erskine, the second Lord Cardross, the son of Henry, Master of Cardross, who had died in 1628. The second Lord was a supporter of The Engagement and was barred from sitting in Parliament in 1649. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Lord. He emigrated to North America to escape religious persecution and established a colony in what is now Carolina. His son, the fourth Lord, succeeded his kinsman in the earldom of Buchan in 1695. However, it was not until 1698 that his claim was established by the Scottish Parliament. For further history of the title, see Earl of Buchan.\nSeveral other members of this branch of the Erskine family have also gained distinction. John Erskine of Cardross, younger son of the second Lord, was a soldier and politician. John Erskine of Carnock, son of John Erskine of Cardross, was a noted jurist. John Erskine, leader of the Evangelical Party in the 18th century Scottish Church, was the son of John Erskine of Carnock by his first wife.

Heggie, Henry Hull and Margaret Wycherly. It was based on a Theatre Guild play with the same name by Paul and Claire Sifton. The film was produced for Universal and was shot on a modest budget of $50,000 at Thomas Edison Studios, which producer/director Chester Erskine had re-opened specifically for the shoot.Humphrey Bogart had a supporting though key role. The film was re-released as Call It Murder by Screen Guild Productions (Guaranteed Pictures) in 1949 after Bogart became a star; he was given top billing, although he is present in few scenes and was credited eighth in the original release.\n\nPlot\nThe movie begins at the murder trial of Ethel Saxon, a woman who shot her lover in a crime of passion. During the trial, Edward Weldon, the jury foreman, asks the defendant a question, which ultimately leads to a guilty verdict and a death sentence for her.\nThe rest of film takes place on the evening of the execution, mostly in the Weldon home. Edward is dealing with the consequences of his role as foreman. Friends have come to the house to support the family. An unscrupulous journalist who has bribed Weldon's son in law is also in attendance. Weldon's daughter Stella is upset by the departure of her gangster boyfriend, Gar Boni, whom she met during the trial. The evening culminates at midnight in a sequence in which three scenes are cross cut together: the switch is pulled at the death house, a gun is fired apparently in Boni's parked car, and a press photograph is taken of Edward Weldon's reaction. Moments later, Stella returns home, under the impression that she has shot Gar Boni. Weldon, torn between love for his daughter and his past pronouncements about the rule of law, contacts the district attorney to come to the house.\n\nCast\nSidney Fox ...  Stella Weldon\nO.P.

It was the first sound film adaptation of the Shakespearean play of the same name. The film was adapted by Taylor from William Shakespeare's play.\n\nCast\nMary Pickford as Katherina\nDouglas Fairbanks as Petruchio\nEdwin Maxwell as Baptista\nJoseph Cawthorn as Gremio\nClyde Cook as Grumio\nGeoffrey Wardwell as Hortensio\nDorothy Jordan as Bianca\n\nProduction\nThe first sound version of the play on film, this version was planned as a sound film from the start. Pickford had already made her sound film debut in Coquette (1929) so The Taming of the Shrew marked her second talkie. This version of the film is primarily known for how Pickford delivers Katherina's last speech. As she moves through the litany of reasons why a woman should obey her husband, she winks toward Bianca, unseen by Petruchio. Bianca smiles in silent communication with Katherina, thus acknowledging that Katherina has not been tamed at all. Pickford and Fairbanks' marriage was breaking down even before filming began, and animosity between the couple increased during filming. In later years, Pickford stated that working on the film was the worst experience of her life, although she also acknowledged that Fairbanks' performance was one of his best.\nFor many years it was believed that one of the credits read \"Additional Dialogue by Sam Taylor\", but there is no evidence any print ever contained such a credit and experts on Shakespeare films, such as Kenneth S. Rothwell and Robert Hamilton Ball, think it unlikely.\n\nReception\nFairbanks biographer Jeffrey Vance, writing in 2008, believes \"Taming of the Shrew has never received the recognition it deserves as the first talking film of a Shakespeare play. It was not only technically superior to the majority of talking pictures in 1929 but would unquestionably be the finest translation onto film of Shakespeare for some time to come.\" Vance also sees the film as a window into the Pickford-Fairbanks marriage: \"As a reenactment of the Pickford-Fairbanks marriage, Taming of the Shrew continues to fascinate as a rather grim comedy. The two willful, larger-than-life personalities working at cross-purposes and conveying their resentment and frustration to each other through blatant one-upmanship and harsh wounds is both the movie and the marital union.\"Leonard Maltin described the film as \u201cdefeated by its lack of pacing and downright embarrassing performances, though it's undeniably fascinating to see Doug and Mary together in their only co-starring appearance. This is the film with the infamous credit, \u2018By William Shakespeare, with additional dialogue by Sam Taylor.\u2019\u201d\n\nHome media\nAfter many years out of circulation, the film was re-released in 1966 in a new cut supervised by Pickford herself. New sound effects and music were added throughout, much of the voice dubbing was enhanced with newly available technology, and seven minutes were cut from the initial print. This re-released version is the only version now available on DVD or VHS.\n\nSee also\nList of early sound feature films (1926\u20131929)\nPassage 7:\nBlackfoot Mountains\nThe Blackfoot Mountains, also called the Blackfoot Range, is a small range of mountains located east of Blackfoot, Idaho. Most of the area is private property, including the range's tallest mountain, Taylor Mountain. This mountain was named after Sam Taylor, an early settler and brother of Matt Taylor. The Blackfoot River carves through the region. Within this range is Wolverine Canyon, a public area that features sites for hiking, camping, kayaking, rock climbing and other recreational pursuits.\n\nEcology\nThis area is mainly a hilly shrub-steppe, covered in sagebrush and juniper.  However, there are many springs and small streams which form microclimates with more water-loving plants. The mountains themselves are mainly basalt.\nPassage 8:\nA Girl in Every Port (1952 film)\nA Girl in Every Port is a 1952 American comedy film directed by Chester Erskine. The film stars  Groucho Marx, Marie Wilson, and William Bendix.

It was produced and distributed by Universal Pictures.\n\nPlot\nMarried college professor Andrew Gentling reluctantly agrees to have a drink with Catherine Sykes, a wartime girlfriend. He is careful to avoid scandal as a founding professor of a new university. However, the next day Catherine is reported missing and is feared to have been murdered after a bloody scarf was found at her ransacked home. Catherine's friend Martha Wier, whom Andrew had also known previously, informs him that Catherine had been romantically involved with Freddie Blair, a crime partner of Catherine's husband. Andrew tries to retrieve Catherine's diary containing evidence of the affair from her bedroom, but he is attacked by a dog and suffers a deep cut on his hand.\nAndrew flees but soon hears a news report that the dog who had attacked him was found to be rabid. As doctors in the area have been advised to immediately report all dog bites, Andrew is unable to receive medical treatment and believes that he is dying. Later, he watches in hiding as Freddie is killed by a passing train.\nAndrew discovers that Catherine is alive and well and that no crime had occurred. No longer eluding capture, he is told that the dog that had attacked him was not actually rabid; the police had concocted the ruse to force the suspect to reveal himself.\n\nCast\nReception\nNew York Times film critic Bosley Crowther called Take One False Step a \"curiously mixed-up mystery picture\" and wrote: \"Something of the same drollery that was displayed by William Powell in his saturnine performance of Nick Charles in the Thin Man films is flashed by him on a few occasions ... But for the most part our erstwhile detective and comedian is forced to play a role of rather painful proportions with forbidding austerity ... Powell is propelled into troubles that are neither funny nor flattering to him. Nor, for that matter, are they gripping as action drama to any great degree.\"\nPassage 10:\nChester Erskine\nChester Erskine (November 29, 1905 \u2013 April 7, 1986) was an American director, producer, and writer.\n\nBiography\nChester Erskine was born in Hudson, New York and studied for a short time at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. His first directing job was Harlem, a 1929 all-black revue. He also directed Spencer Tracy in the Broadway production of The Last Mile in 1930. Erskine's likeness was drawn in caricature by Alex Gard for Sardi's, the New York City theater district restaurant. The picture is now part of the collection of the New York Public Library.In 1932, he began working in Hollywood, where his best-known work includes the direction of The Egg and I and the screenplay adaptation of All My Sons.Other films directed by Erskine include the 1949 mystery Take One False Step starring William Powell and the 1952 comedy A Girl in Every Port featuring Groucho Marx.\nErskine produced a number of films, notably The Wonderful Country, a 1959 western with Robert Mitchum.\nHe died in Beverly Hills, California at the age of 80.", "answers": ["Sam Taylor"], "incorrect_answer": "Chester Erskine"}, {"input": "Which of the city at the south of Shelly Beach, New South Wales is a local government area in the Hunter region of New South Wales, Australia?", "context": "Passage 1:\nNiagara Park, New South Wales\nNiagara Park is a suburb of the Central Coast region of New South Wales, Australia 6 kilometres (4 mi) north of Gosford's central business district.

The City of Newcastle incorporates much of the area of the Newcastle metropolitan area.\nThe Lord Mayor of City of Newcastle Council is Councillor Nuatali Nelmes, a Labor politician. Nelmes was elected at a by-election on 15 November 2014 following the resignation of Jeff McCloy, the former Lord Mayor. The Awabakal and Worimi peoples are acknowledged by council as the traditional custodians of the land and waters of Newcastle.\n\nHistory\nFollowing the passing of the Municipalities Act 1858 by the New South Wales parliament, the Municipality of Newcastle was proclaimed on 7 June 1859. The new Municipality was divided into three wards \u2013 City, Macquarie, and Honeysuckle.  Eight years later, the Municipalities Act 1867 classified the Newcastle Municipality as a \"Borough\".The Greater Newcastle Act 1937 merged the City of Newcastle with 10 of its suburban municipalities to form the City of Greater Newcastle. The Act also transferred parts of the Lake Macquarie Shire and Tarro Shire to the new city. The amalgamations and transfers took effect from 2 April 1938.The newly created City of Greater Newcastle was subsequently renamed to City of Newcastle on 23 March 1949.\n\nProposed amalgamation\nAfter a 2015 review by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal found that Newcastle City Council was not \"fit for the future\", it was recommended that the City of Newcastle merge with Lake Macquarie City Council. However, the Minister for Local Government subsequently proposed that Newcastle City Council instead merge with Port Stephens Council to form a new council with an area of 1,045 km2 (403 sq mi) and support a population of approximately 230,000. The outcome of an independent review was completed by mid\u20132016. On 14 February 2017, the NSW Government announced it would not be proceeding with further regional council mergers, including the Newcastle City Council and Port Stephens Council merger.\n\nDemographics\nAt the 2016 census, there were 155,411 people in the City of Newcastle local government area, of these 49.3 per cent were male and 50.7 per cent were female. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 3.5 per cent of the population, which was higher than the national and state averages of 2.9 and 2.9 per cent. The median age of people in the City of Newcastle was 37 years, just below the national median of 38. Children aged 0 \u2013 14 years made up 16.9 per cent of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 16 per cent of the population. Of people in the area aged 15 years and over, 40.7 per cent were married and 15.4 per cent were either divorced or separated.Population growth in the City of Newcastle between the 2001 census and the 2006 census was 3.91 per cent; and in the subsequent ten years to the 2016 census, population growth was 9.64 per cent. When compared with total population growth of Australia for the same periods, being 5.78 per cent and 17.86 per cent respectively, population growth in the City of Newcastle local government area was significantly lower than the national average. The median weekly income for residents within the City of Newcastle was marginally lower than the national average.At the 2016 census, over 80% of residents in the City of Newcastle local government area stated their country of birth as Australia significantly exceeding the national average of 66.7%. Almost 60% of all residents in the City of Newcastle nominated a religion with Catholicism being at almost 25%, which was slightly higher than the national average of 22.6%. As at the 2016 census, households in the City of Newcastle local government area had a significantly lower than average proportion (11.6%) where a language other than English is spoken (national average was 22.2%).\n\nCouncil\nCurrent composition and election method\nNewcastle City Council is composed of thirteen councillors, including the Lord Mayor, generally for a fixed four-year term of office. The Lord Mayor is directly elected while the twelve other Councillors are elected proportionally as four separate wards, each electing three Councillors. The most recent election was held in September 2021.  The Lord Mayor elected at that time, Jeff McCloy, resigned in 2014, and a by-election for Lord Mayor was held on 15 November 2014.  The current makeup of the council, including the Lord Mayor, is as follows:\n\nThe current Council, elected in September 2021, in order of election by ward is:\n\nSister cities\nNewcastle Council has sister city relations with the following cities:\nPassage 3:\nShelly Beach, New South Wales\nShelly Beach is a coastal suburb of the Central Coast region of New South Wales, Australia, located east of Tuggerah Lake and bordering the Pacific Ocean south of The Entrance. It is part of the Central Coast Council local government area. It is 66 km south of Newcastle & 93 km north of Sydney.  Shelly Beach is considered one of the most popular surfing beaches on the Central Coast.\nShelly Beach Golf Club (previously Tuggerah Lakes Gold Club) is an 18-hole golf course located at the eastern end of Shelly Beach Road, overlooking Shelly Beach. It was formally established in 1930, originally being located at Killarney Vale until 1954 when it moved to its present location.\nWithin the suburb there is the Shelly Beach Surf Club and the Shelly Beach Fossils soccer club.\n\nTransportation\nRed Bus Services operates routes through Shelly Beach (11, 12, 21, 22, 23).  Bus 21 operates from The Entrance North to Gosford regularly.\n\nNotable people\nNikki Garrett \u2013 golfer\nBanjo Paterson \u2013 poet\n\nAccommodation\nShelly Beach Cabins\nBluewater Resort\nSun Valley Tourist Park\nPassage 4:\nShelly Beach (Manly)\nShelly Beach (also known as Shelley Beach) is a beach located in Manly, a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is adjacent to North Head and Fairy Bower. Shelly Beach is a western facing beach on the eastern coast of Australia.  \nShelly Beach is part of the no take Cabbage Tree Bay Aquatic Reserve.\n\nHistory\nThere is evidence of occupation of Aboriginal people in the area; in particular a shell midden has been recorded near the Fairy Bower car park. This is the reason for its name even though the beach itself is not that shelly. One hundred years ago Shelly Beach was a haven for boat owners, Providing protection from winds and seas from the south. What's also changed is the hillside, which in the early 1920s was home to only several buildings but is now covered with expensive homes from which their occupants can take advantage of the expansive views to the north. There is an old motorbike standing on the seabed in the middle of the bay in around 8m of water.\nOn the weekend of June 4 & 5, 2016 a severe storm caused extensive damage to the walkway between Manly Beach and Shelly Beach.  This included considerable damage to the pathway - with large slabs of concrete being lifted and displaced, the complete disappearance of a small toilet block, damage to an iconic sculpture at Fairy Bower pool and large sections of the safety railing being destroyed. Due to safety concerns, a large barrier and warning signs were installed to discourage people from walking along the path until repairs were made. Despite this, many people ignored the warnings and simply climbed around the rocks to get back to the path. The barriers were removed in August 2016, following the completion of remediation work.\n\nGeography\nShelly Beach is protected from the ocean swell by the reef that lies on the right hand side of the beach (when facing the ocean) and faces west. Cabbage Tree Bay is a small north-facing embayment that includes two small beaches. Shelly Beach is a reflective beach about 100 metres long. Shelly Beach is a protected marine reserve since it is part of Cabbage Tree Bay.\nThe visibility is good and a large variety of marine life can be seen there.\nIt is excellent for scuba divers, and also for snorkelers as Shelly beach does not get very deep, its maximum depth being about 12 metres. Many areas are shallow with depths ranging from 2 to 6 metres. This particularity makes it popular for casual and regular snorkelers. Cabbage Tree Bay was declared a 'No Take' Aquatic Reserve on 31 March 2002.On the western point of the beach is a surf break known as \"Bower\" which offers one of the most shallow breaking waves in Sydney. Further along from Bower are Winki and Deadman's, two other well-known breaks which are popular with surfers, especially on south-east, and east swells. Shelly Beach is also one of only a handful of west-facing ocean beaches on the east coast of Australia.\n\nInfrastructure\nFacilities include 2 free electric barbecues, showers, toilets and a kiosk selling meals, drinks and coffee. There is a restaurant on the beach called The Boathouse Shelly Beach. There is a bush track around the headland with views of the Northern Beaches and North Head. The facilities also include parking at the rate of $8.00 an hour. Many scuba diving centres take students because it offers excellent conditions for an environment in which to learn SCUBA.\n\nWildlife\nThe report also states that 'more than 160 species of marine fish have been recorded within the reserve, including protected species such as the weedy or common sea dragon, the elegant wrasse and the threatened black cod.\n\nFame\nIn the opening scene of the 1983 film BMX Bandits, two characters ride their bicycles down the walkway between Manly Beach and Shelly Beach.\n\nSee also\nBeaches in Sydney\nShelly Beach in Cronulla\nPassage 5:\nBucketty\nBucketty is a locality in the City of Cessnock local government area (LGA), in New South Wales, Australia. It is in the south of the LGA, immediately adjacent to the border with the City of Hawkesbury and Central Coast Council, in the Hunter Region, about 105 km (65 mi) north of Sydney, and 55 km (34 mi) from Cessnock, New South Wales, the council seat. Bucketty is presumably the Aboriginal word for mountain spring.Bucketty is situated on a ridge of ironstone hills separating Yengo National Park from the Central Coast.Bucketty has no services and the nearest general stores are located in Laguna and Kulnura. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service maintains the Bucketty & District Rural Fire Brigade and the Fire Shed is the social centre of the town. When rural addressing was introduced, the numbering was based on the distance from Broke, and some of the streets were also given names.\n\nBackground\nBucketty and the surrounding bushland contains some of the country's most significant Aboriginal sites, including Mt Yengo.  In the early 1800s pioneers settled in Murrays Run, and one of the most significant roads of the colony, the 220 km-long (136 mi) Great North Road between Sydney and Newcastle, was built using convict labour.\nThe current community of Bucketty (186 people) was only established in 1972.  It was in Bucketty that the Convict Trail Project was conceived \u2013 a heritage initiative that manages the restoration, maintenance and promotion of the convict-built road [1]. The community is also involved in the Wombat Rescue Project which has attracted national attention and has an MoU with the NPWS to self-manage the Convict Wall site that is part of the Yengo National Park. This site is a focal point for community activities, such as the Concerts under the Stars and the annual Carols by Candlelight. The community has received several awards for its various activities and initiatives [2].\nPassage 6:\nGrahamstown Dam\nGrahamstown Dam is a major off-stream earthfill Embankment dam with a controlled labyrinth spillway and baffle chute that stores water from the Williams River. The dam is located north of Newcastle and within the Port Stephens Council local government area in the Lower Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia. The dam's main purpose is water supply; it provides about 40 per cent of the potable water for the Hunter region; and is the Hunter's largest drinking water supply dam.\nThe impounded reservoir is called Grahamstown Lake or the Grahamstown Storage Reservoir.\n\nLocation and features\nGrahamstown Dam is immediately adjacent to residential areas in the town of Raymond Terrace, less than 4 km (2.5 mi) from the Raymond Terrace CBD.\nCommenced in 1955, completed in 1965, and commissioned in 1969, Grahamstown Dam is a major dam that receives its main inflow from the Williams River as well as its own catchment. Water flows into the Grahamstown Dam from the Williams River, upstream from the Seaham Weir, which limits the inflow of tidal seawater; via Balickera Canal and pumping station, which are used to transfer water from the Williams River to Grahamstown Dam. The Campvale Pumping Station; George Schroder Pumping Station and delivery mains are used to deliver water from the dam to the water treatment plant; and Grahamstown Water Treatment Plant.The storage was formed by building an embankment across the outlet of a natural depression known as the Grahamstown Moors. Construction began in 1955, and although all the elements of the entire scheme were not completed until 1965, water was first supplied in 1960 during the severe drought from 1960 to 1963. The dam was built by the NSW Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission on behalf of the Hunter Water Corporation to supply water to the Hunter Region.The dam wall consists of 2,124 cubic metres (75,000 cu ft) of earthfill with an internal earth core. It is 12 m (39 ft) high and 4.8 km (3 mi) long. At 100% capacity the dam wall holds back 190,000 megalitres (6,700\u00d710^6 cu ft) of water. The surface area of Grahamstown Lake is 2,460 ha (6,079 acres) and the catchment area is a relatively small 97 km2 (37 sq mi). The controlled labyrinth spillway is capable of discharging 800 cubic metres per second (28,000 cu ft/s).\n\nUpgrade of facilities\nSince the dam was completed, major modifications include:\n1973: a bentonite clay core 2.02 km (1.3 mi) in length was installed in the central section of the embankment to provide a watertight seal, the 1.5 m (5 ft) thick core has an average depth of 21.3 m (70 ft);\n1985: the Full Supply Level of the dam was reduced from 11.1 m (36.4 ft) to 10.6 m (34.8 ft) as a temporary measure to reduce the risk of damage to the main embankment from major flooding;\n1994: further work was undertaken to raise the level of the clay core to road level over the full length of the embankment and rock armouring of the main embankment was also undertaken; and\n2005: the Full Supply Level was increased to 12.8 m (42 ft) and provided 50 per cent more storage capacity by constructing a spillway northeast of Raymond Terrace and a new discharge channel under the Pacific Highway.\n\nCriticism\nAt the time of the proposal for the construction of a dam at Tillegra, it was claimed that Hunter Water Corporation deliberately allowed the water storage levels in Grahamstown Dam run down in order to inflate the case for the A$477 million Tillegra project.\n\nSee also\nIrrigation in Australia\nList of dams and reservoirs in New South Wales\nPassage 7:\nGillieston Heights\nGillieston Heights is a suburb of the City of Maitland local government area in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia, approximately 5.1 km (3.2 mi) from the Maitland CBD. Prior to 1967, the village was named East Greta however this was changed to honour former Maitland mayor and member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly John Gillies following a poll of residents. At the 2016 census, Gillieston Heights had a population of 3,150.\n\nHistory\nThe Traditional Owners and Custodians of the Maitland area are the Wonnarua people.Following the discovery of high quality coal by prospector T.W. Edgeworth David in 1888, a group of local businessmen purchased 245 acres (99 ha) of land surrounding present-day Gillieston Heights and were within weeks able to produce coal which was transported by dray to Maitland for sale. To capitalise on this success, the East Greta Coal Mining Company was established in 1891. The company constructed a railway line from West Maitland to the East Greta colliery, completed in 1893. Orders to supply coal for power companies in Sydney, Melbourne and Bundaberg saw the company declare a dividend in 1896 and expand its operations, sinking a second mine shaft the same year.\n\nAs the coal mining activities in the area were expanded, the railway line from Maitland was extended further to the south, and a station platform was opened at East Greta in 1902, with passenger services to Stanford Merthyr near the town of Kurri Kurri. Initially, passengers had to walk to Maitland railway station to connect with trains operated by New South Wales Government Railways, but in 1903 this service was extended to Maitland, and a year later to Cessnock on the newly extended South Maitland Railway. Mining operations at the East Greta colliery ceased following a miners strike in 1929 and subsidence caused by floods in 1930s damaged the workings. After closure the plant & rail sidings at the 2 collieries were soon removed. The village consisting of permanent dwellings which had been erected to house miners remained. After the closure of the mine, the town continued to be served by passenger trains until 1967 when the privately run passenger service over the line between Cessnock and Maitland ended. Coal traffic over the line to services to collieries in the Cessnock area continued.\nSince 2005, Gillieston Heights has experienced rapid population growth, with large residential developments approved as part of the Maitland City Council's urban settlement strategy. The population doubled between 2005 and 2011, with the rapid growth placing pressure on Gillieston Public School, leading to the acquisition of more land for future expansion.\n\nPopulation\nAccording to the 2016 census of Population, there were 3,150 people in Gillieston Heights.\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 6.3% of the population.\n88.3% of people were born in Australia and 91.8% of people spoke only English at home..\nThe most common responses for religion were No Religion 27.4%, Catholic 25.1% and Anglican 24.8%.\n\nTransport\nGillieston Heights is served by Rover Coaches route 164 to Cessnock and Maitland. The rapid population growth in the suburb and other former mining villages in the area has led to calls by Maitland and Cessnock councils to reinstate passenger services on the South Maitland Railway, connecting to Newcastle to ease congestion on regional roads. A new station at Gillieston Heights has been identified as a priority.\nPassage 8:\nMount View, New South Wales\nMount View, New South Wales is a rural locality located in the Hunter Region wine region in New South Wales Australia. It is located Between Cessnock and Wollombi and is a part of the City of Cessnock local government area. It has ideal climate, soil, and temperature for viticultural pursuits, which have been practised here since the mid-19th century. The road from Cessnock to Mount View provides access to the Great North Walk, and to lookouts with excellent views of the Hunter Region.\n\nGeography\nMount View is located in the Hunter Valley region, it is blanketed in a dense forest with periodic clearing throughout its foothills. The area around the mountain is mostly rural pastures, littered with small farmhouses. There are some creeks that run down from the mountains peak, these provide water to the surrounding rural area.\nPassage 9:\nUnincorporated Far West Region\nThe Unincorporated Far West Region is an unincorporated area in the Far West region of New South Wales, Australia. The area is one of only two areas in New South Wales that are not part of any local government area (the other is Lord Howe Island). The region includes several small towns including Tibooburra, Milparinka and Silverton. Silverton and Tibooburra have village councils. The region surrounds Broken Hill, but does not include it, which is in the separate City of Broken Hill local government area.\nThe region has an area of 93,299 square kilometres (36,023 sq mi) which is slightly larger than Hungary and smaller than South Korea.\n\nDemographics\nAs at the 2016 census, all unincorporated areas of NSW had a population of 1056; around 400 of these were on the distant and unrelated Lord Howe Island. The statistics below refer to a combination of all unincorporated areas of NSW. They had the highest male to female ratio in New South Wales, estimated at 115.5 males per 100 females in 2016.", "answers": ["City of Newcastle"], "incorrect_answer": "Port Macquarie"}, {"input": "Which as more species Cassiope or Deutzia?", "context": "Passage 1:\nEricaceae\nThe Ericaceae () are a family of flowering plants, commonly known as the heath or heather family, found most commonly in acidic and infertile growing conditions. The family is large, with c. 4250 known species spread across 124 genera, making it the 14th most species-rich family of flowering plants. The many well known and economically important members of the Ericaceae include the cranberry, blueberry, huckleberry, rhododendron (including azaleas), and various common heaths and heathers (Erica, Cassiope, Daboecia, and Calluna for example).\n\nDescription\nThe Ericaceae contain a morphologically diverse range of taxa, including herbs, dwarf shrubs, shrubs, and trees. Their leaves are usually evergreen, alternate or whorled, simple and without stipules. Their flowers are hermaphrodite and show considerable variability. The petals are often fused (sympetalous) with shapes ranging from narrowly tubular to funnelform or widely urn-shaped. The corollas are usually radially symmetrical (actinomorphic) and urn-shaped, but many flowers of the genus Rhododendron are somewhat bilaterally symmetrical (zygomorphic). Anthers open by pores.\n\nTaxonomy\nMichel Adanson used the term Vaccinia to describe a similar family, but Antoine Laurent de Jussieu first used the term Ericaceae. The name comes from the type genus Erica, which appears to be derived from the Greek word ere\u00edk\u0113 (\u1f10\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03ba\u03b7). The exact meaning is difficult to interpret, but some sources show it as meaning 'heather'. The name may have been used informally to refer to the plants before Linnaean times, and simply been formalised when Linnaeus described Erica in 1753, and then again when Jussieu described the Ericaceae in 1789.Historically, the Ericaceae included both subfamilies and tribes. In 1971, Stevens, who outlined the history from 1876 and in some instances 1839, recognised six subfamilies (Rhododendroideae, Ericoideae, Vaccinioideae, Pyroloideae, Monotropoideae, and Wittsteinioideae), and further subdivided four of the subfamilies into tribes, the Rhododendroideae having seven tribes (Bejarieae, Rhodoreae, Cladothamneae, Epigaeae, Phyllodoceae, and Diplarcheae). Within tribe Rhodoreae, five genera were described, Rhododendron L. (including Azalea L. pro parte), Therorhodion Small, Ledum L., Tsusiophyllum Max., Menziesia J. E. Smith, that were eventually transferred into Rhododendron, along with Diplarche from the monogeneric tribe Diplarcheae.In 2002, systematic research resulted in the inclusion of the formerly recognised families Empetraceae, Epacridaceae, Monotropaceae, Prionotaceae, and Pyrolaceae into the Ericaceae based on a combination of molecular, morphological, anatomical, and embryological data, analysed within a phylogenetic framework. The move significantly increased the morphological and geographical range found within the group. One possible classification of the resulting family includes 9 subfamilies, 126 genera, and about 4000 species:\nEnkianthoideae Kron, Judd & Anderberg (one genus, 16 species)\nPyroloideae Kosteltsky (4 genera, 40 species)\nMonotropoideae Arnott (10 genera, 15 species)\nArbutoideae Niedenzu (up to six genera, about 80 species)\nCassiopoideae Kron & Judd (one genus, 12 species)\nEricoideae Link (19 genera, 1790 species)\nHarrimanelloideae Kron & Judd (one species)\nEpacridoideae Arn. (=Styphelioideae Sweet) (35 genera, 545 species)\nVaccinioideae Arnott (50 genera, 1580 species)\n\nGenera\nSee the full list at List of Ericaceae genera.\n\nDistribution and ecology\nThe Ericaceae have a nearly worldwide distribution. They are absent from continental Antarctica, parts of the high Arctic, central Greenland, northern and central Australia, and much of the lowland tropics and neotropics.The family is largely composed of plants that can tolerate acidic, infertile conditions. Like other stress-tolerant plants, many Ericaceae have mycorrhizal fungi to assist with extracting nutrients from infertile soils, as well as evergreen foliage to conserve absorbed nutrients. This trait is not found in the Clethraceae and Cyrillaceae, the two families most closely related to the Ericaceae. Most Ericaceae (excluding the Monotropoideae, and some Epacridoideae) form a distinctive accumulation of mycorrhizae, in which fungi grow in and around the roots and provide the plant with nutrients. The Pyroloideae are mixotrophic and gain sugars from the mycorrhizae, as well as nutrients.In many parts of the world, a \"heath\" or \"heathland\" is an environment characterised by an open dwarf-shrub community found on low-quality acidic soils, generally dominated by plants in the Ericaceae. A common example is Erica tetralix. This plant family is also typical of peat bogs and blanket bogs; examples include Rhododendron groenlandicum and Kalmia polifolia. In eastern North America, members of this family often grow in association with an oak canopy, in a habitat known as an oak-heath forest.In heathland, plants in the family Ericaceae serve as hostplants to the butterfly Plebejus argus.Some evidence suggests eutrophic rainwater can convert ericoid heaths with species such as Erica tetralix to grasslands. Nitrogen is particularly suspect in this regard, and may be causing measurable changes to the distribution and abundance of some ericaceous species.\nPassage 2:\nDeutzia silvestrii\nDeutzia silvestrii is a species of Safflower in the family Hydrangeaceae. It is found in central China (\u7ea2\u82b1\u6eb2\u758f; h\u00f3ng hu\u0101 s\u014du sh\u016b).\nPassage 3:\nCassiope mertensiana\nCassiope mertensiana is a species of flowering plant known by the common names western moss heather and white mountain heather.\nThis heather is native to subalpine areas of western North America, from Alaska to the mountains of California. It is a small, branching shrub which forms patches along the ground and in rocky crevices.\n\nDescription\nCassiope mertensiana has short, erect, snakelike stems that are covered in tiny leathery scalelike leaves only a few millimeters long. From between the layers of scale leaves emerge reddish  pedicels each bearing a petite, hanging, down-facing, bell-shaped flower. The bractlets are red and the contrasting flower is white.\n\nAlthough the shrub tends to grow in areas where there is a lot of accumulation of snow, adequate rain precipitation is needed for the continued growth of Cassiope Mertensiana. The shrub must be exposed to enough sunlight and warmer conditions for proper growth during the growing season.\nPassage 4:\nCassiope lycopodioides\nCassiope lycopodioides, Haida Gwaii mountain-heather or clubmoss mountain heather, is a plant species native to North America.\n\nDistribution\nIt is found in southern Alaska, British Columbia, and the US State of Washington.\nIt is found on rocky slopes in arctic and alpine tundra at elevations up to 2000 m. In Washington, it is reported only from King County. The specific epithet \"lycopodioides\" refers to the plant's superficial resemblance to some species of clubmoss (Lycopodium sensu lato).\n\nSubspecies\nCassiope lycopodioides subsp. cristapilosa, known only from the Haida Gwaii (formerly called the Queen Charlotte Islands), is recognized as a distinct taxon by some authorities but not others.\n\nDescription\nCassiope lycopodioides is a perennial herb forming mats lying close to the ground. Leaves are narrow, up to 3 mm long, closely pressed against the stem. Flowers are white, bell-shaped, up to 20 mm across.\nPassage 5:\nDeutzia\nDeutzia ( or ) is a genus of about 60 species of flowering plants in the family Hydrangeaceae, native to eastern and central Asia (from the Himalayas east to Japan and the Philippines), and Central America and also Europe. By far the highest species diversity is in China, where 50 species occur.\nThe species are shrubs ranging from 1\u20134 m (3 ft 3 in \u2013 13 ft 1 in) in height. Most are deciduous, but a few subtropical species are evergreen. The leaves are opposite, simple, with a serrated margin. The flowers are produced in panicles or corymbs; they are white in most species, sometimes pink or reddish. The fruit is a dry capsule containing numerous small seeds. Identification of the species is very difficult, requiring often microscopic detail of the leaf hairs and seed capsule structure.\nDeutzia is named after the 18th century Dutch patron of botany, Johan van der Deutz.\n\nSelected species\n\nCultivation and uses\nThe deutzias are fairly new to gardens: the exception, D. scabra, was noticed in Japanese gardens by Engelbert Kaempfer (1712) and Carl Peter Thunberg (1784) but not actually seen in Europe till the 1830s; two-thirds of the species noted in the R.H.S. Dictionary were gathered in from the wild during the 20th century.Deutzias are commonly grown as ornamental plants for their white and pink flowers. Many cultivars and hybrids have been selected for garden use, including selections with double flowers. For example, Deutzia \u00d7 lemoinei is a hybrid of D. gracilis and D. parviflora. The following cultivars and hybrids have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:-\n\nThe temperate deutzias are mostly hardy shrubs from far eastern regions where winters are dependably frozen; in milder climates, like much of England, the early-flowering species and hybrids are coaxed into premature bloom by mild spells, then spoilt by frost. Alice Coats remarks that deutzias have done better in Edinburgh, on the chilly east coast of Scotland, than in London. A solution in milder climates might be to site deutzia in the garden's most exposed, coldest microclimate, as is often done with early-flowering magnolias.\nIdentification can be difficult, and in particular, many of the plants in cultivation sold as D. scabra are actually D. crenata (Huxley 1992). The selected hybrid white double \"Pride-of-Rochester\", already in cultivation in 1881, was originated by the Rochester, New York nurserymen Ellwanger and Barry.Deutzia scabra is used by joiners in Japan to polish wood.\nPassage 6:\nCassiope\nCassiope is a genus of 9-12 small shrubby species in the family Ericaceae. It is the sole genus in the subfamily Cassiopoideae. They are native to the Arctic and north temperate montane regions. The genus is named after Cassiopeia of Greek mythology. Common names, shared with several other similar related genera, include heather and heath. They have scale-like leaves lying against the stems, and produce solitary bell-shaped flowers in late spring. Though hardy, flowers can be damaged by late frosts.\nThey are cultivated in gardens, suitable sites being rock gardens, peat banks or glades in woodland areas.,\nPassage 7:\nHarrimanella\nHarrimanella is a genus of flowering plant in the heath family Ericaceae, with a single species, Harrimanella hypnoides, also known as moss bell heather or moss heather.   It was originally named Cassiope hypnoides by Linnaeus (1737) in his Flora Lapponica, but Harrimanella hypnoides is now the accepted name at Integrated Taxonomic Information System. The species name hypnoides means 'like Hypnum ', which is a genus mosses.\nThe plant is a cold hardy dicot perennial found growing on rock crevices in the Canadian arctic, Quebec, the Northeastern United States, Greenland, Iceland, the mountains of Norway, Sweden and Finland, Svalbard and arctic Russia, including the Ural mountains.Harrimanella hypnoides produces moss-like cushions, about 5 cm high, often of prostrate stems with ascending shoot tips. The leaves are scale-like, looking like those of a moss. The flowers are conspicuous, white and bell shaped with five fused petals and five sepals. They are borne singly on short reddish pedicels. The fruit is an erect capsule.\nPassage 8:\nDeutzia ningpoensis\nDeutzia ningpoensis is a shrub in the family Hydrangeaceae.  The species is endemic to China. It grows to between 1 and 2.5 metres high and produces panicles of white flowers from May to July in its native range.", "answers": ["Deutzia"], "incorrect_answer": "Cassiope"}, {"input": "Peter Curtis and Scott Draper are both what?", "context": "Passage 1:\nScott Draper\nScott Dennis Draper (born 5 June 1974) is an Australian former tennis player and golfer.

Draper had accepted an offer from Sam Stosur to play in the mixed doubles at the 2005 Australian Open which also finished on 30 January. Draper and Stosur reached the semi-final, which meant that Draper had to play in the first round of the golf in the morning and the semi-final of the tennis in the afternoon. Draper played his second round on the following day but missed the cut. This meant he was free to compete in the final of the mixed doubles on 30 January. On 11 February 2007, Draper won the New South Wales PGA Championship on the Von Nida Tour. He finished the four-round event with a score of 268, 20-under-par, one stroke ahead of Andrew Bonhomme and Aaron Townsend.

Made by Hammer Films, it was adapted by Nigel Kneale from the 1960 novel The Devil's Own by Norah Lofts, published under the pseudonym Peter Curtis.\n\nPlot\nSchoolteacher Gwen Mayfield comes back to England after suffering a nervous breakdown caused by an attack by witch-doctors while working in a mission in Africa. She's hired by the wealthy Reverend Alan Bax, who runs a school in the remote village of Heddaby. Once there, Gwen finds out Alan is not actually a minister, and only wears a clerical collar out of \"a sense of security\"; the only church in the village is in ruins. Meanwhile, she befriends Alan's sister, an esteemed journalist.\nThe romance between two of Gwen's students, Ronnie Dowsett and Linda Rigg, is sternly opposed by adults in the village for reasons Gwen can't understand. Linda lives with her grandmother, who's rumoured to be a witch and Ronnie fears is abusing Linda.\nAs Ronnie is a gifted student, Alan proposes to pay for his stay at a prep school outside the village, but the boy's father is against it. Gwen volunteers to tutor the boy.\nRonnie gives Linda a male doll as a mate to her female one, to represent them as a couple. The next day, Ronnie falls into a coma, and Gwen finds the male doll with pins stuck through it and its head missing. She shows it to Stephanie, who indicates someone might be dabbling in witchcraft. Impressed by Gwen's knowledge of magical practices in Africa, Stephanie invites her to coauthor an article about witchcraft in contemporary England.\nRonnie's superstitious mother becomes upset when Gwen asks her about Ronnie's state. Later, she goes to Granny Rigg's house to work out a deal. The next day, Ronnie is out of the coma and is quickly taken by his mother to stay with her relatives in Wales. Ronnie's father confronts Granny Rigg about it and is later found drowned in a nearby pond.\nGwen starts to think people who believe themselves to be witches are behind these incidents, and realizes that if they're trying to keep Ronnie apart from Linda, it could mean they might be planning to sacrifice her as a virgin. She announces her will to testify at the inquest into Ronnie's father's death. Following an injury caused by Stephanie's dogs, Gwen is taken to the Baxes' home where she is treated by the local doctor. During the night, she gets frightened by the sudden appearance of an African totem, and suffers another nervous breakdown.\nMonths later, Gwen is recovering in a nursing home with no recollection of ever leaving Africa. After a visiting little girl's doll triggers the return of her memories, she escapes the hospital and hitchhikes back to Heddaby, where she's welcomed to stay at the Baxes' again. One of the villagers whispers to her that Linda, officially in vacation at her cousin's, has actually been taken by the witches.\nOne night, Gwen sees from the Baxes' window a group of people scurrying toward the ruined church, and goes to investigate, finding a witches' coven led by Stephanie, who reveals she had planned to initiate Gwen into their ranks. Stephanie explains that she has learned a ritual that extends life through the ritual sacrifice of a pure maiden, planned for the next night, in occasion of Lammastide. The place of sacrifice is to be kept spiritually clean or the power of the ritual will turn upon the witch. Unable to find where they are hiding Linda, Gwen waits for the ceremony. Linda is there but in a trance, unable to assist in her own rescue. As Stephanie raises the ritual knife to kill the girl, Gwen cuts herself and smears her blood on Stephanie's robe, defiling it. Seized with convulsions, Stephanie tries to remove her soiled garb, but falls dead.\nWeeks later, freed of Stephanie's influence, Heddaby has returned to normal. Gwen chooses to stay and work as a schoolteacher for Alan.\n\nCast\nProduction\nThe village of Hambleden, Buckinghamshire, was the filming location for the fictional village of Heddaby. Interiors were filmed at Hammer's usual studio at Bray in the same year that the famous horror film company vacated their home altogether for (mainly) Elstree and Pinewood. The cast featured child-actor Martin Stephens, then 17. The supporting cast also included Hammer regular Duncan Lamont, as well as John Collin, Michele Dotrice, Leonard Rossiter and Bryan Marshall. The score was by Richard Rodney Bennett.\n\nCritical reception\nVariety called the film \"routine entertainment\". The Hammer Story: The Authorised Biography of Hammer Films called the film \"unsettling, though compromised by a hysterical climax\", writing, \"when The Witches strikes the right balance it ultimately succeeds as an engrossing thriller, even if it ultimately disappoints as Hammer horror.\"On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 67% of 9 critics' reviews are positive.\nPassage 7:\n1999 Stella Artois Championships \u2013 Singles\nScott Draper was the defending champion but lost in the third round to Sargis Sargsian.\nPete Sampras won in the final 6\u20137(1\u20137), 6\u20134, 7\u20136(7\u20134) against Tim Henman.\nThis was the only year in which Roger Federer competed in this tournament.\n\nSeeds\nThe top eight seeds received a bye to the second round.\n\nDraw\nKey\nFinals\nTop half\nSection 1\nSection 2\nBottom half\nSection 3\nSection 4\nExternal links\n1999 Stella Artois Championships draw\nPassage 8:\n2005 Australian Open \u2013 Mixed Doubles\nSamantha Stosur and Scott Draper defeated Liezel Huber and Kevin Ullyett in the final 6\u20132, 2\u20136, [10\u20136] to win the mixed doubles title at the 2005 Australian Open.

It was during this time that Thinking Fellers produced their most prominent albums, Lovelyville, and Strangers from the Universe. They toured the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and the UK in 1994 and made an appearance on the John Peel radio show on the BBC. In 1996 they toured briefly as an opening act for the alternative rock band Live but were not received well by the Live fanbase.

Formed in 1991, they achieved success with their 1993 album Dig, which featured the charting single \"Believe\". The band then released the album Defenders of the Universe in 1996. It was followed by their third album Life Like in 1999, in which they then disbanded that same year. They reunited briefly from 2004 to 2008, and again in 2016. Vocalist/guitarist Scott Hackwith and guitarist Jon Morris are the only members to stay in the band for its entire run, although the current lineup also consists of original guitarist Johnny Cornwell.\n\nHistory\nDig formed in 1991 within Los Angeles, as vocalist Scott Hackwith had previously produced for The Ramones and had worked in the studio for various bands. Hackwith and drummer Anthony Smedile formed the band together, and they then recruited Jon Morris on guitar and backing vocals, Johnny Cornwell on guitar, and Phil Friedmann on bass. After releasing a demo EP in 1992 titled Runt, they signed with Radioactive Records and issued their first full-length album in 1993, the self-titled Dig. It was produced by Dave Jerden, who was well-known for producing '90s albums by bands such as Alice in Chains and Anthrax. The album peaked at No. 153 on the Billboard 200 and at No. 6 on the Billboard Heatseekers charts. The single \"Believe\" was played regularly on MTV's Buzz Bin and it had reached No. 19 on the Billboard Modern Rock Chart and at No. 34 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart. Although \"Believe\" was the band's hit song, the record labels had done an unlikely move, and issued four other singles from the same album, although they all failed to chart in the United States. Overseas in the United Kingdom, Dig had fared a bit better on the UK Singles Chart, as \"Believe\" peaked at No. 83, \"Unlucky Friend\" peaked at No. 96, and \"I'll Stay High\" peaked at No. 97, all in 1994. The single \"Unlucky Friend\" had featured four tracks recorded by Dig while on Mark Radcliffe's FM radio show while they toured the UK. The band toured with the likes of Prong and Blind Melon to promote the album. Towards the end of 1994, Dig released the promotional Soft Pretzel EP, which included three original songs and also a Pink Floyd cover, \"Fearless\". Also in 1994, the band's song \"Curious George Blues\" was exclusively recorded for the soundtrack to the movie Airheads. The following year, their cover of the \"Theme From Fat Albert\" was included on the compilation Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits. They also recorded another exclusive song, \"Hu Hu Hu\", for the soundtrack of the movie Virtuosity.\nFrom the beginning of 1995 until the middle of 1996, the band had not gone on any tours due to their prior exhaustive schedule; however, in 1996, they released their second album, Defenders of the Universe. The album was almost entirely mixed by Tom Lord-Alge, a mixer with hundreds of credits to his name. The album and its touring cycle had guitarist Cornwell replaced by Dix Denney, and drummer Smedile replaced by Matt Tecu. Unlike the previous album, none of the songs charted, and the album itself had not charted either. The following year, Dig's record label parent MCA had shifted them from Radioactive Records to their other imprint, Uptown Records.\nAfter the label shift, the band released their third album Life Like in early 1999. Sylvia Massy took over mixing duties for the entirety. The album was recorded as a four-piece, since guitarist Denney left the band and both Hackwith and Morris handled guitar duties. Other changes in the lineup included original bassist Friedmann replaced by Jay Nicholas, and drummer Tecu replaced by Gene Trautmann. For the touring cycle, bassist Nicholas was replaced by Rob Redick, and guitarist Joel Graves was added into the band, to round out the five members; however, with a lack of support from the band's record label and only sporadic shows being played, the band was dropped from Uptown/MCA in July 1999, and the Uptown label itself officially went defunct later in the year. After the small touring cycle, new bassist Redick joined Candlebox and new drummer Trautmann joined Queens of the Stone Age. Original guitarist Morris had stepped away as well, and it signified the end of Dig.\nIn 2004, the band reappeared, and played sporadic one-off shows. The lineup included frontman Hackwith, original guitarists Morris and Cornwell, second drummer Tecu, and new bassist Jamie Carter; however, when 2007 rolled around, Tecu was replaced by Dave Stedronsky and Carter was replaced by prominent Rocket From the Crypt member Pete Reichert. They recorded the first new Dig song in years, titled \"No One's There\", and it appeared on a Poison Tree Records: Road to Nowhere compilation, alongside bands such as Fu Manchu and The Dwarves. Afterwards, various sessions of recording commenced; however, nothing ever surfaced.\nIn 2016, the band was revived yet again to play a singular show in West Hollywood. Along with Hackwith, Morris, and Cornwell, new bassist Marcus Blake and new drummer Charlie George had joined the lineup. After another period of only random updates, the band launched their own independent merch store in early 2020 and had started recording again, but with new bassist Tommy Black joining the band. In November 2020, the band announced a new album with an unknown release date, posting a sample on their official social media outlets. The album's first single, titled \"Nothing Is Forever\", was released in January 2021 with an accompanying music video. The second song, \"Treatment\", was released the following month with a music video as well.On March 10, 2023 former guitarist Denney (who appeared on Dig's second album Defenders of the Universe) died at the age of 65. Dig returned to a live setting in July 2023, and the lineup changed again with the additions of Ernesto Mora on bass and Matt Bennett on drums.\n\nMembers\nCurrent members\nScott Hackwith \u2013 vocals, guitars (1991\u20131999, 2004\u20132008, 2016\u2013present)\nJon Morris \u2013 guitars (1991\u20131999, 2004\u20132008, 2016\u2013present)\nJohnny Cornwell \u2013 guitars (1991\u20131995, 2004\u20132008, 2016\u2013present)\nErnesto Mora \u2013 bass (2023\u2013present)\nMatt Bennett \u2013 drums (2023\u2013present)\n\nPast members\nPhil Friedmann \u2013 bass (1991\u20131997)\nAnthony Smedile \u2013 drums (1991\u20131995)\nDix Denney \u2013 guitars (1995\u20131997); died 2023\nMatt Tecu \u2013 drums (1995\u20131997, 2004\u20132006)\nJay Nicholas \u2013 bass (1997\u20131998)\nGene Trautmann \u2013 drums (1997\u20131999)\nJoel Graves \u2013 guitars (1998\u20131999)\nRob Redick \u2013 bass (1998\u20131999)\nJamie Carter \u2013 bass (2004\u20132006)\nPete Reichert \u2013 bass (2006\u20132008)\nDave Stedronsky \u2013 drums (2006\u20132008)\nMarcus Blake \u2013 bass (2016\u20132020)\nCharlie George \u2013 drums (2016\u20132023)\nTommy Black \u2013 bass (2020\u20132023)\n\nTimeline\nDiscography\nStudio albumsDig (1993, Radioactive / MCA)\nDefenders of the Universe (1996, Radioactive / MCA)\nLife Like (1999, Uptown / Universal)EPs and singlesRunt EP (1992, Wasteland)\n\"Feet Don't Touch the Ground\" (1993, Wasteland)\n\"Fuck You\" (1993, Radioactive)\n\"Believe\" (1993, Radioactive)\n\"I'll Stay High\" (1993, Radioactive)\n\"Unlucky Friend\" (1994, Radioactive)\nSoft Pretzel EP (1994, Radioactive)\n\"Whose Side You On?\" (1996, Radioactive)\n\"Live in Sound\" (1999, Universal)\n\"Nothing Is Forever\" (2021, Cassette Recordings)\nPassage 5:\nThe Strapping Fieldhands\nThe Strapping Fieldhands are an American indie rock band based in Philadelphia, and are associated with the Siltbreeze label and American lo-fi psych scene.

Founded as a studio-only project in 1990, the band's nucleus comprises musicians Dale Flattum, Eric Holland and Mike Morasky. Morasky and Flattum are also known for being founding members of the noise/industrial rock group Steel Pole Bath Tub, which the duo continued their involvement with concurrent to Milk Cult. Milk Cult is known for their found-sound experiments and dense sample-based compositions, as well as their collaborations with numerous musical acts, including Faith No More, Jawbreaker, Grotus, Neurosis, Thinking Fellers Union Local 282 and The Geraldine Fibbers.\n\nHistory\nMilk Cult was founded in 1990 and issued their debut album, titled Love God in 1992 on Boner Records. The album contained music inspired by the group's score for the Frank Grow film of the same title. Burn or Bury followed in 1994 and featured the collaborative efforts of Mike Patton, Billy Gould, Lars Fox, Carla Bozulich, Blake Schwarzenbach, Paul Reller, Dave Edwardson, Scott Kelly and Steve Von Till. Bruse Lee Marvin Gaye was released in 1995 and featured music recorded in 1994 with Japanese musicians Masaya Nakahara, Hideki Yoshimura, Hidekazu Miyahara and Pop Suzuki.\nIn 1997, Milk Cult was contacted by the French government and offered an opportunity to participate in a Marseille-based art collective. The group obliged and traveled to France to record for a year, with their efforts eventually surfacing as the material for their fourth album. Titled Project M-13, the album featured numerous guests and embraced world music while continuing to experiment with sampling and hip hop beats.After the release of Project M-13 the members of Milk Cult devoted themselves to separate projects. Morasky turned his focus to movie special-effects and worked as a technician on The Lord of the Rings films. Continuing the found-sound experiments of Milk Cult but in a more accessible form, Flattum and former Steel Pole Bath Tub drummer Darren Morey formed Novex, who released an album titled Kleptophonica in 2002. Eric Holland released his debut solo album Borders, Battles & Beers in 2010 and continues to work as a music engineer, recording with musical acts such as Mike Patton and his band Tomahawk.\n\nDiscography\nLove God (Boner Records, 1992)\nBurn or Bury (Priority Records, 1994)\nBruse Lee Marvin Gaye (ZK Records, 1995)\nProject M-13 (0 To 1 Records, 2000)\nPassage 9:\nI Hope It Lands\nI Hope It Lands is an album by the American band Thinking Fellers Union Local 282. It was released in 1996 through Communion Records.\n\nCritical reception\nThe Orlando Sentinel called the album \"another mad collection of brief sound collages, twisted pop tunes and fractured chunks of art-rock.\" The Santa Fe New Mexican concluded that \"their songs are like singing telegrams from the distant cosmic spring that flows down to both Sonic Youth and Captain Beefheart.\" Trouser Press declared that \"the band has the miraculous group-mind of a flock of birds, and the record flows like nothing they\u2019ve ever done before\u2014even the little noise-twiddles are part of the record\u2019s grand mid-air arc.\"\n\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nThinking Fellers Union Local 282Mark Davies \u2013 vocals, guitar, banjo\nAnne Eickelberg \u2013 vocals, bass guitar, piano\nBrian Hageman \u2013 vocals, guitar, mandolin, tape\nJay Paget \u2013 drums, percussion, keyboards\nHugh Swarts \u2013 vocals, guitarProduction and additional personnelGibbs Chapman \u2013 production, recording\nMargaret Murray \u2013 design\nThinking Fellers Union Local 282 \u2013 production, recording\nPassage 10:\nThe Funeral Pudding\nThe Funeral Pudding is an EP by the band Thinking Fellers Union Local 282, released in February 1994 through Ajax Records.\n\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nThinking Fellers Union Local 282Mark Davies \u2013 instruments\nAnne Eickelberg \u2013 instruments\nBrian Hageman \u2013 instruments\nJay Paget \u2013 instruments\nHugh Swarts \u2013 instruments, answering machine message on \"The Invitation\"Production and additional personnelGreg Freeman \u2013 production, engineering\nMatt Hall \u2013 painting\nThinking Fellers Union Local 282 \u2013 production", "answers": ["yes"], "incorrect_answer": "No"}, {"input": "In what year did construction begin on the stadium where the 2013 America East Men's Lacrosse Tournament was held?", "context": "Passage 1:\n2010 America East Men's Lacrosse Tournament\nThe 2010 America East men's lacrosse tournament was the 11th edition of the America East Conference men's lacrosse tournament and took place from May 4 to May 8 at the higher seeds home field.

LaValle Stadium\nThe Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium is the main stadium for Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, New York, United States. Construction began in 2000 at a cost of approximately $22 million. With a capacity of 12,300 people (10,300 seating and 2,000 standing), it is the largest outdoor facility in Suffolk County. The stadium is home to the Division I Stony Brook Seawolves and their football, men's soccer, women's soccer, men's lacrosse, and women's lacrosse teams.The stadium opened on September 14, 2002. It was named in honor of New York state senator Kenneth LaValle on October 19, 2002. LaValle played a key role in the development and creation of the stadium. The stadium consists of a three-tier press box on the east side, as well as six luxury suites, a press box, television and radio booths, and a camera deck on the roof. Its most recent expansion came in 2017, with the addition of 2,000 seats in the north end zone and a new concessions and restrooms facility.\nLaValle Stadium has hosted the 2006 and 2010 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship quarterfinals, as well as the 2011, 2012 and 2018 NCAA Division I Women's Lacrosse Championship final fours and title games.LaValle Stadium was listed at No. 22 on a 2012 Yahoo! Sports list of \"College Football's Top 25 Toughest Places to Play\".\n\nHistory\nAs Stony Brook planned its transition to Division I from Division III, a new football stadium was immediately deemed necessary to replace Seawolves Field, a 1,000-seat bleacher stadium with muddy sinkholes that had existed since 1984. The first proposal in 1994 called for a $4 million multi-use stadium for football and lacrosse. However, 500 professors petitioned Governor Mario Cuomo to stop the stadium from being built along with Stony Brook's transition to Division I, because they worried a new stadium would add more traffic to the Three Villages, attract a rowdy crowd on weekends and take money from academic programs.Construction on a new stadium began in 2000. Originally slated to cost $12 million, the final structure cost $22 million and was fully supported by Stony Brook president Shirley Strum Kenny, who said she was \"serious about the athletic program, serious about Division I\", and expected Stony Brook to became \"important\" and \"a contender.\"Seawolves Stadium opened on September 14, 2002 as the Stony Brook Seawolves football team faced the St. John's Red Storm in Stony Brook's first game as a Division I program. Stony Brook won 34\u20139, and the opening kickoff was returned for a touchdown by the Seawolves. At the time of its opening, the 8,136-seat stadium was the largest in Suffolk County, a record that is still held today.On October 19, 2002, the date of Stony Brook's Homecoming game against Sacred Heart, the stadium was renamed the Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium in honor of New York state senator Kenneth P. LaValle, a key figure in the development and creation of the $22 million facility. Before its opening, the Stony Brook Director of Marketing and Promotions for Athletics had opened up the possibility of renaming the stadium for a corporate partnership or a former president of Stony Brook University.The stadium's name has been the subject of numerous controversies, including in 2009 after LaValle voted against the legalization of gay marriage in New York and in 2019 when LaValle voted against a ban on gay conversion therapy.\n\nExpansions\nIn October 2012, Stony Brook University allocated $5.7 million for the addition of at least 2,000 seats to LaValle Stadium, bringing the seating capacity from 8,300 to 10,300, with a standing capacity of 2,000 bringing the stadium's total capacity to 12,300.New York governor Andrew Cuomo vetoed a $22 million upgrade to the stadium in 2015, money which was originally allocated for a \"computational biomedicine visualization and drug development magnet facility.\" The Senate had attempted to change the usage of the funds in the state budget as the intended programs no longer existed.An expansion was completed in the summer of 2017 and added 2,000 seats in the north end zone, as well as a new concessions and restrooms facility. Before the 2018 season, a new turf field was installed in LaValle Stadium, also adding red end zones and a new midfield logo.\n\nEvents hosted\nIn October 2005, LaValle Stadium was chosen to be the host site for the two North Region contests in the 2006 NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament, with both of the games aired on ESPN2. It was the first time that Stony Brook had hosted any NCAA postseason championship even since the program's move to Division I in 1999. A sold-out crowd of 8,335 attended the events. Stony Brook was again chosen to host the North Region games in the 2011 NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament quarterfinals.A sold-out crowd of 10,024 watched the 2010 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship quarterfinals at LaValle Stadium, where No. 8-seeded Stony Brook fell 10\u20139 to No. 1-seeded Virginia, falling one goal short of the Final Four.LaValle Stadium first hosted the Final Four and championship game of the NCAA women's lacrosse tournament in 2011, after three consecutive seasons of being held at Towson University's Johnny Unitas Stadium. A crowd of 8,011 witnessed Northwestern beat Maryland in the title game. The event resulted in 20,000 people visiting the Stony Brook region and $100,000 in hotel revenue. Stony Brook was chosen to host the 2012 Final Four as well. The Final Four returned to Stony Brook in 2018.LaValle Stadium was set to host three games of the 2020 Premier Lacrosse League (PLL) season, including a nationally televised game on NBC in June, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the league held its season in a bubble in Utah instead.\n\nAttendance records\nThe most attended game in Kenneth P.

Chabichou is formed in a cylindrical shape which is called a \"bonde\", per the shape of the bunghole of a wine barrel. and is aged for 10 to 20 days. It is the only goat cheese that is soft ripened allowed by Protected Designation of Origin regulations to be produced using pasteurized milk. Chabichou is very white and smooth, and flexible to the palate, with a fine caprine odor.\n\nHistory\nThe legend of Chabichou goes back to 732, at the time of the defeat of the Arabs in the area, in the 8th century, after the Battle of Poitiers. Many of them left the area but some settled there with their families and, in particular, their goat herds. The countryside was appropriate for grazing the \"poor man's cow\", as the pastures were excellent. The cheese was then named cheblis (\"goat\", in Arabic), which would become \"chabichou\" thereafter. However, the domestication of the goat in this area is supposed to date back to Roman colonization, and extends up to the present.\n\nLe Chabichou du Poitou\nChabichou du Poitou, made exclusively in the north of Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, acquired its AOC status in 1990  with the assistance of the efforts of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. It is known for its characteristic label. Its production rose to 555 tons in 2003.\nSince 1782, Chabichou du Poitou has been mentioned in the French \"Guide du voyageur \u00e0 Poitiers et aux environs\". When regional wine production slowed in the late 1800s due to the European phylloxera crisis, production of Chabichou increased; production increased again with the development of the cooperative dairies (1906 in Bougon).\n\nThe AOC production zone is limited to an area south of Haut-Poitou: the south of Vienne, the Deux-S\u00e8vres and the north of the Charente.\nSee the official website of Chabichou du Poitou at http://www.chabichou-du-poitou.eu.\n\nManufacture\nChabichou of Poitou is made of fresh and whole goat's milk. It is quickly but slightly pressurized: less than 100 microliters per liter of milk. They then let the milk coagulate during a 24-hour period between 20 and 22 \u00b0C. This curd is then moulded manually with a ladle or mixer into perforated and truncated moulds and left to drain for another 18 to 24 hours while turning it over it two or three times, maintaining it at 22 \u00b0C. Afterwards, they are removed from the moulds and salted with dry salt or sometimes in a brine bath. It is then laid out in drying rooms, i.e. it is drained while being placed in moulds for 24 to 48 hours. Afterwards it is left to mature in cellars at between 10 and 12 \u00b0C and within 80% to 90% humidity. It remains there for at least 10 days, but generally for two or three weeks. Some are even preserved for months for a more vigorous flavor.\n\nSee also\nList of goat milk cheeses\nPassage 2:\nLoire Valley\nThe Loire Valley (French: Val de Loire, pronounced [val d\u0259 lwa\u0281]; Breton: Trao\u00f1 al Liger), spanning 280 kilometres (170 mi), is a valley located in the middle stretch of the Loire river in central France, in both the administrative regions Pays de la Loire and Centre-Val de Loire. The area of the Loire Valley comprises about 800 square kilometres (310 sq mi). It is referred to as the Cradle of the French and the Garden of France due to the abundance of vineyards, fruit orchards (such as cherries), and artichoke, and asparagus fields, which line the banks of the river. Notable for its historic towns, architecture, and wines, the valley has been inhabited since the Middle Palaeolithic period. The oldest known Neanderthal engravings have been found a cave in La Roche-Cotard which have been dated to more than 57,000 years ago. In 2000, UNESCO added the central part of the Loire River valley to its list of World Heritage Sites.\n\nGeography and climate\nThe valley includes historic towns such as Amboise, Angers, Blois, Chinon, Montsoreau, Orl\u00e9ans, Saumur, and Tours.\nThe climate is favorable most of the year, the river often acting as a line of demarcation in France's weather between the northern climate and the southern. The river has a significant effect on the mesoclimate of the region, adding a few degrees of temperature. The climate can be cool with springtime frost while wine harvest months may have rain. Summers are hot; however, influences from the Atlantic moderate the temperature with breezes.\n\nWine\nThe Loire Valley wine region is one of the world's most well-known areas of wine production and includes several French wine regions situated along the river, from the Muscadet region on the Atlantic coast to the regions of Sancerre and Pouilly-Fum\u00e9 just southeast of the city of Orl\u00e9ans in north-central France. Loire wines tend to exhibit a characteristic fruitiness with fresh, crisp flavors.\n\nCulture\nOn 2 December 2000, UNESCO added the central part of the river valley, between Chalonnes-Sur-Loire and Sully-sur-Loire, to its list of World Heritage Sites. In choosing this area that includes the French d\u00e9partements of Loiret, Loir-et-Cher, Indre-et-Loire, and Maine-et-Loire, the committee said that the Loire Valley is: \"an exceptional cultural landscape, of great beauty, comprised of historic cities and villages,  great architectural monuments - the ch\u00e2teaux - and lands that have been cultivated and shaped by centuries of interaction between local populations and their physical environment, in particular the Loire itself.\"The Loire Valley chansonniers are a related group of songbooks attributed to the composers of the Loire Valley and are the earliest surviving examples of a new genre that offered a combination of words, music, and illuminations.A new Contemporary Art offer is developing all along the Loire River from Montsoreau to Orl\u00e9ans with such places as Ch\u00e2teau de Montsoreau-Contemporary Art Museum, CCCOD Tours, the Domaine R\u00e9gional de Chaumont sur Loire and the Frac Centre Orl\u00e9ans. They are a rare association of Renaissance architecture with contemporary art.\n\nArchitecture\nThe architectural heritage in the valley's historic towns is notable, especially its ch\u00e2teaux, such as the  Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise, Ch\u00e2teau d'Azay-le-Rideau, Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord, Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau, Ch\u00e2teau de Chinon, Ch\u00e2teau de Montsoreau, Ch\u00e2teau du Rivau, Ch\u00e2teau d'Uss\u00e9, and Ch\u00e2teau de Villandry. The ch\u00e2teaux, numbering more than three hundred, include the necessary castle fortifications built in the 10th century but also the splendour of those built half a millennium later. When the French kings began constructing their huge ch\u00e2teaux here, the nobility, not wanting or even daring to be far from the seat of power, followed suit. Their presence in the lush, fertile valley began attracting the very best landscape designers. In addition to its many ch\u00e2teaux, the cultural monuments illustrate to an exceptional degree the ideals of the Renaissance and the Age of the Enlightenment on western European thought and design. Many of the ch\u00e2teaux were designed to be built on the top of hills, one example of this is the Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise. Many of the ch\u00e2teaux had extremely detailed and expensive churches on the grounds, or within the actual ch\u00e2teau itself.\n\nEconomy\nThe European Commission reported that in 2016, three categories accounted for most of the economy in the Pays-de-la-Loire region: services (including tourism) provided 66.7% of employment, industry 26.5% and agriculture, 3.9%. The unemployment rate was 8.8%. In 2015, the region ranked eighth in France in terms of economic performance producing 5.0% of the gross domestic product. Important economic sectors included leather goods, textile, shipyard/construction and aeronautics, agriculture and food-processing as well as the plastics industry. The EC did not produce a report for the larger Loire Valley region.\nAccording to another source, tourism in the Loire Valley was supported by over 700 hotels and 550 restaurants in the region. In addition to the chateaux and some 700 other listed Historic monuments, attractions included three Regional nature Parks, 550 km of cycling tracks, 800 listed Historic monuments, over 100 museums and 30 golf courses.In April 2019, The Guardian's travel section included one Loire Valley location in its list of 20 of the most beautiful villages in France: Montr\u00e9sor, \"a fairytale village with a rich history\" evidenced by \"the wool market, the Halle de Cardeux, ... the 16th-century Logis du Chancelier, ... a riverside walk, Balcons de l'Indrois, [and] ... Jardinier Bridge\".According to a 2017 report by CNN, the 42 chateaux that make up the UNESCO World Heritage Site receive over 3.3 million visitors per year. The Daily Telegraph newspaper (2014) listed the following as the premiere chateaux for tourists: Chinon, Cit\u00e9 royale de Loches, Chaumont, Blois, Meung, Chenonceau, Rivau, Lemer\u00e9, Amboise, Clos Luc\u00e9, Amboise, Chambord, Villandry and Valen\u00e7ay.\n\nSee also\nOrl\u00e9ans\nPassage 3:\nBerber cuisine\nThe Berber cuisine (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0628\u062e \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0628\u0631\u064a), though lacking a singular and standardized culinary framework, encompasses a diverse range of traditional dishes and influenced by the numerous flavours from distinct regions across North Africa. There is no consistent Berber cuisine, and it has been exposed to various influences. Berbers' meal choices were shaped by local availability of foods and personal finances. Berbers follow the same dietary laws and hygiene requirements as other Muslims. Ken Albala noted that \"Describing meals as typically Berber is impossible\u2013at best, they are samples of what is eaten in different regions by Berber families\".Berber cuisine differs from one area to another within North Africa and West Africa (Mauritania). For this reason, every dish has a distinct and unique identity and taste according to the specific region it originates from in North Africa, with some dishes estimated to be more than a thousand years old. Zayanes of the region of Kh\u00e9nifra around the Middle Atlas have a cuisine of a remarkable simplicity. It is based primarily on corn, barley, ewe's milk, goat cheese, butter, honey, meat, and game.\n\nSee also\nMoroccan cuisine\nLibyan cuisine\nMauritanian cuisine\nBerber culture\nPassage 4:\nCrottin de Chavignol\nCrottin de Chavignol is a goat cheese produced in the Loire Valley. This cheese is the claim to fame for the village of Chavignol, France, which has only two hundred inhabitants.\n\nHistory\nThe small cylindrical goat cheese from the area around Chavignol has been produced since the 16th century, but the earliest extant written record dates from 1829 when its name and brief details of the cheese were recorded by a tax inspector.The etymology is dubious: the word crot described a small oil lamp made from burned clay, which resembles the mould used to prepare the cheese. Another explanation is that old Crottin gets harder and browner and tends to look like dung, the French word for an animal dropping being crotte.\n\nQuality control\nProtected by the AOC Seal, Crottin de Chavignol is produced today with traditional methods. If a cheese is labelled \"Crottin de Chavignol\", it has to be from the area around Chavignol, and it has to meet the stringent AOC production criteria.\n\nFlavour and age\nCrottin de Chavignol is subtle and slightly nutty. In its youth (Chavignol jeune), its dough is solid and compact, and its rind is white. As it ripens (Chavignol bleut\u00e9), it takes on a stronger flavour and develops a harder rind. With full maturity (Chavignol affin\u00e9), the dough becomes crumbly and the mould on the rind matures into a bluish colour. The cheese is marketed and eaten at all three stages of maturity.\n\nRecipes\nA classic dish is baked Crottin de Chavignol on a green salad. The dish is said to go well with a Sancerre wine from its home region. Although commonly served as a baked starter, Chavignol is also often found cold as a component element of a cheese board selection.\n\nSee also\nList of goat milk cheeses\nPassage 5:\nLaura Chenel\nLaura Chenel (born 1948\u20131949) is a cheese maker who was America's first commercial producer of goat cheese, and helped to popularize goat cheese in America. In 1979, she began producing ch\u00e8vre in the Bay Area town of Sebastopol, California, after a fact-finding trip to visit goat cheese producers in France. After several months of working to sell her product to local markets (with mixed success, due to American unfamiliarity with goat cheeses at the time), she received her first major opportunity when Alice Waters of Chez Panisse in Berkeley, California placed a standing order for her cheese in 1980. Waters listed the cheese by name on her menu (as \"Laura Chenel's Ch\u00e8vre\", in what may have been the first American instance of goat cheese salad), which provided Chenel with a great deal of publicity. Eventually, her operation would grow to sell over two million pounds of cheese per year. The company primarily manufactures fresh ch\u00e8vre, although aged cheeses make up roughly 10% of its business. In 2006, Chenel sold the company to the Rians Group fr, a French corporation which has purchased multiple small farming operations, while retaining ownership of her herd of five hundred goats.\n\nSee also\nList of cheesemakers\nPassage 6:\nPiute Pass Archeological District\nThe Piute Pass Archeological District is an archaeological district located along Piute Creek in eastern San Bernardino County, California. The district encompasses the area around the historic Fort Piute and includes a variety of prehistoric and historic resources. The Piute Pass area was inhabited by several Native American tribes dating back to the middle Holocene epoch. The Patayan people lived in the area during the late prehistoric period, while the Chemehuevi people lived there after the Patayan and through the early historic period. Both groups left petroglyphs in the area, and remains of Chemehuevi habitation sites have also been discovered. After European settlers came to the region, the pass became the site of Fort Piute, a U.S. Army redoubt which protected travelers along the Mojave Road.The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 14, 1973.\nPassage 7:\nSantar\u00e9m cheese\nSantar\u00e9m is a goat cheese from Portugal produced in several different regions, most notably in the Santar\u00e9m district and in Serra de Santo Ant\u00f3nio in the Ribatejo province of Portugal. It is considered to taste best ripe after aging, in servings of between 50 grams to 100 grams. Best production practices call for its being preserved in good quality edible oil.\n\nSee also\nList of goat milk cheeses\nPassage 8:\nQueijo de Cabra Transmontano\nQueijo de Cabra Transmontano (Transmontano Goat's Cheese) is a type of cheese made from goat milk (goat cheese) from Alto Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes, Norte Region, Portugal. It has a Protected designation of origin (PDO) and is listed on the Ark of Taste.\nPassage 9:\nTine (company)\nTINE SA (Norwegian pronunciation: [\u02c8t\u00ec\u02d0n\u0259]) is the largest Norwegian dairy product cooperative consisting of around 15,000 farmers and 5,600 employees. As of 2013, it has a revenue of 20.4 billion Norwegian kroner (NOK) ($3.41bn, \u00a32.04bn, \u20ac2.50bn). The parent company, TINE SA, is a cooperative society owned by its suppliers, the milk producers who deliver milk to the company. The corporation domestically offers the entire spectrum of dairy products, and in many dairy categories, Tine faces little or no domestic competition. This monopolistic position has led to criticism of Tine when shortages occur. Tine's internationally known products are Jarlsberg cheese, Sn\u00f8frisk goat cheese, Heidal cheese, Ridder cheese, and Ski-Queen (geitost). Tine is the most dominant of the thirteen agricultural cooperatives in Norway.\n\nHistory\nDairy cooperatives in Norway go back to 1856, with the first nationwide dairy co-op Den Norske Meieriforening (the Norwegian Dairy Association) being founded in 1881.  The company dates back to 1928, when \"Norske Meieriers Eksportlag\" (Norwegian Dairies' Export Company) was started. It changed its name to \"Norske Meieriers Salgssentral\" (Norwegian Dairies' Sales) in 1942, and to \"Norske Meierier\" (Norwegian Dairies) in 1984. The Tine name has been used as an easily identifiable brand name since 1992 for the company's dairy products.  In 2008, Tine was ranked the world's #1 cooperative by size by the International Cooperative Alliance. In 2010, the company was changed to a nationwide group adapted to the Cooperatives Act, which was introduced from 2008, and the name was changed to TINE SA. TINE SA is one of the 13 farmer-owned nationwide cooperatives that are members of the interest organization Norsk Landbrukssamvirke.\nThe \"tine\" is a traditional Norwegian wooden container, not unlike the Shaker-style pantry box, which could be used to keep butter and cheese fresh.\n\nSubsidiaries\nSubsidiaries which are partly or fully owned by Tine:\nDiplom-Is, Scandinavia's largest ice-cream producer (100% owned by Tine)\nFjordland, a ready-made food company (51% owned by Tine)\nNorseland Ltd., Ireland and the United Kingdom division (100% owned by Tine)\nNorseland Inc., distributes and markets Tine's cheeses in Canada and the United States (100% owned by Tine)\nSunniva, produces and distributes juice and soft drinks in Norway (100% owned by Tine)\nOsteCompagniet, sells and markets expensive cheeses in Norway (100% owned by Tine)\nWernersson Ost, sells and markets domestic and international cheeses in Sweden and Denmark (100% owned by Tine)\nPassage 10:\nFlor de Gu\u00eda cheese\nFlor de Gu\u00eda cheese is a Spanish cheese (Spanish: Queso de Flor de gu\u00eda) made on the island of Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands. It has Denomination of Origin protection. The cheese is classified as fatty or semi-fatty and made from the milk from Canarian sheep, with milk from Canarian cows and/or goats. The milk from the sheep must constitute at least 60% and  cows\u2019 milk content must never exceed 40%. Goat milk must never exceed 10% of the mixture. The cheese is presented in flat cylindrical cheeses which normally measure 4\u20138 cm (1.5-3 inches) high and 20\u201330 cm (8-12 inches) across and weighing between 2 and 5 kg (4.5-11 pounds). The cheese gets its name from an area in northern Gran Canaria called Santa Mar\u00eda de Gu\u00eda, where the cheese is made, and \u2018flor\u2019 from the fact that juice from the flowerheads of a species of cardoon and globe artichoke are used to curdle the milk.\n\nManufacture\nThe cheese is made in three varieties:\n\n\u201cFlor de Gu\u00eda\u201d, which uses only the juice of the flowerheads of the cardoon in the coagulation.\n\u201cHalf Flor de Gu\u00eda\u201d (Sp: media Flor de gu\u00eda) which uses 50% cardoon juice and 50% globe artichoke flower juice to coagulate the milk.\n\u201cGu\u00eda cheese\u201d which uses some vegetable coagulant and some animal coagulant, usually rennet from young goats or from lambs.In addition, the cheeses can be classified as semi-cured and cured, according to the length of maturation.\nThe cheese is made only in the neighbouring municipalities of Santa Mar\u00eda de Gu\u00eda, Moya and G\u00e1ldar and is seasonal in production only being manufactured between January and July.\n\nThe milk is provided by sheep which are kept on open terrain, free to move to new pastures within the designated geographical area. Their food is largely wild plants and grass supplemented by concentrates when necessary. The cows are kept stabled for most of the year but when conditions are favourable they are tethered in open pasture. The goats are grazed on fenced land within the specified area and gathered in at night. The animals may be milked mechanically or manually. The former are conditions of the Spanish Denomination of Origin.The curdling medium may be vegetable or animal depending on the type of cheese being made. Salt is added to the milk but not exceeding 30 grams (1.1 oz) per 100 litres (galls) of milk. For Flor cheese, the vegetable rennet (liquid extract of the cardoon) is added when the milk has been heated to between 28 \u00b0C and 35 \u00b0C and maintained for 60 to 90 minutes. For Half-Flor cheese the curdling agent must be 50% cardoon juice and 50% another vegetable or authorized rennet. It is heated to 28\u201338 \u00b0C and maintained for a maximum of 1 hour. For Gu\u00eda cheese the rennet used may be animal, vegetable or chemical or a mixture. The milk is heated to 30\u201338 \u00b0C and maintained for as long as an analysis shows it to be ready.The curd is then cut to the size of between rice grains and chickpeas with the typical lyres. It stands and drains and is then put into moulds for pressing. The pressing and moulding may be done manually or mechanically. The moulds for Flor de gu\u00eda cheese have marks on their interiors to impart the geometric shape of a flower on the rind. Salt is sprinkled lightly on the face of the cheese in addition to the previously added salt. The cheese remains inside the ring-mould for 24 hours. It must then be matured for a minimum of 15 days and may be matured up to 60 days. During this time the cheeses are turned regularly and smoothed to improved their appearance. They may also be oiled with olive oil or some other vegetable oil. The older cheeses may have piment\u00f3n or gofio applied to the exterior. Any products used on the exterior of the cheese must be indicated on the packing.\n\nFlavour\nOverall the flavour is of dairy products with a saltiness, varying slightly according to the milks used. It does not have a very intense flavour, a creaminess and sometimes can be a little acid or spicy.\n\nTexture\nThe texture is dense and without cavities. It can vary between firm and soft depending on its maturation. The colour is from ivory-white to yellow, depending on its age.\n\nRind\nThe rind can vary in colour from dark brown in long-matured cheeses to an ivory-white to cream on the less matured cheeses. The thickness of the rind depends on the maturation, a medium thick rind on older cheeses and a very thin rind on the less matured specimens. There may or may not be a flower design on the top face of the cheese.", "answers": ["Middle Palaeolithic period"], "incorrect_answer": "Neolithic period"}, {"input": "What was the event where Jacob Minah had his personal best also known as?", "context": "Passage 1:\nPatrick Johnson (sprinter)\nPatrick Johnson (born 26 September 1972 in Cairns, Queensland, Australia) is an Australian athlete of Aboriginal and Irish descent. He is the current Oceanian and Australian record holder in the 100 metres with a time of 9.93 seconds, which he achieved in Mito, Japan, on 5 May 2003. With that time he became the first person not of African ancestry to break the 10-second barrier (Frankie Fredericks, a Namibian, had been the first non-West-African in 1991). The time made him the 17th fastest man in history at the time and 38th man to crack the 10-second barrier. He was regarded as the fastest man of non-African descent before Christophe Lemaitre ran 9.92 seconds in French National Championships in Albi on 29 July 2011.He reached the finals in both the 100 and 200 metres at the 2006 Commonwealth Games, and the 200m final in the 2005 World Championships, where he finished 6th.

It is located in the Northern Ontario Ring of Fire, in the James Bay Lowlands 90 kilometres (56 mi) west of Attawapiskat in the remote northern part of the province. In June 2005, the Attawapiskat First Nation voted in favour (85.5%) of ratifying the Impact Benefit Agreement (IBA). Construction of the mine began in February 2006 which created 3200 positions; mining and operations will create around 400 permanent positions. The Victor Mine is an open-pit mine, with a processing plant, workshops, and an airstrip located on site. By 2013\u20132014 royalties collected from De Beers Victor Mine amounted to $226. At that time De Beers was continuing to pay off its \"$1 billion investment to build the mine and from now until it closes, the company expects to pay tens of millions of dollars in royalties.\" The mine completed mining and processing in 2019 and has moved to a shut-down phase including demolition of infrastructure and rehabilitation of the site.\n\nHistory\nDe Beers started looking for Kimberlite Pipes within Canada in the 1960s. \"The Victor Mine was developed within a cluster of 16 kimberlite pipes that were discovered in the James Bay Lowlands near Attawapiskat in 1987.\"  In 1995 the pipes of the James Bay Lowland area were re-examined and interest was renewed in the Victor Mine Project. The cost feasibility of mining Victor diamonds was done in 2002. In 2005, the Project gained approval after an environmental assessment by the Federal and Provincial government and soon after construction began. In 2007, the Moose Cree First Nations peoples signed in favour of the Victor mine and the first successful productions of diamonds began. June 20, 2008, Victor Mine entered the production phase. De Beers celebrated its opening July 26 and reached an agreement with the Government of Ontario to allow up to 10% of the mine's production to be available to the cutting and polishing industry in Ontario. In October 2009, the Victor Mine was voted \u201cMine of the year\u201d by readers of the international trade publication called Mining Magazine.\n\nGeology\nThe area is composed of 18 kimberlite pipes of the Attawapiskat kimberlite field, 16 of which are diamondiferous, the Victor Mine sits on top of the Victor pipe and mines from Victor Main and Victor Southwest which have appeared close enough to the surface to be used in an open-pit mine. The Victor Kimberlite is a composition of pyroclastic crater facies and hypabyssal facies, and is considered to have a highly variable diamond grade.\n\nMining\nIt is an open-pit mine; the equipment there is 100 tonne trucks, large front-end loaders, bulldozers and other necessary support equipment used in the mining operation. The annual production rate is 2.7 million tonnes a year, which comes to about 600,000 carats a year in diamond grade.\n\nOperations\nThere is year-round access via air travel and only seasonal access over land depending on whether the weather permits travel. On the property are warehouses for storage, a processing plant, workshops, offices, fuel storage facilities, pit-dewatering machinery and an airstrip (the Victor Mine Aerodrome) for travel needs. The site also has recreational and dorm buildings for the permanent staff. The life of the mine is expected to be twelve years and the total project life is seventeen years and each year the processing plan is designed to treat 2.5 million tonnes of kimberlite per year (roughly 7100 tonnes a day).\n\nTom Ormsby, director of external and corporate affairs for De Beers Canada claims that the great colour (whiteness), natural shapes, clearness and quality of the Victor diamonds ranks them with the highest stones in the world.\"Victor is forecasted to have a 17-year cradle-to-grave life. That includes construction, an estimated 12 years of operation and then winding down to closure and rehabilitation of the site.\"\n\nPerformance\nThe mine had produced at a high level of performance leading to \"[f]urther exploration of the site\" with the \"hope that De Beers will uncover another source of diamonds within close proximity of the existing operation.\" 826,000 carats were mined at Victor Mine in 2010 and \"$93 million was spent on goods and services and $49 million (53 per cent) was supplied by Aboriginal businesses.\"\"No corporate, federal, provincial taxes or government royalties other than personal income taxes were paid in 2010 as the company was in a loss position for tax purposes.\" However, De Beers Canada \"injected approximately $474,900,000 into the Canadian economy in 2010\" through both mines, Snap Lake and Victor Mines.In 2011, De Beers paid total wages and benefits of about $55.5 million to Victor employees. According to the Ontario Mining Association, in 2011 \"$101 million was spent on goods and services\" by De Beers \"with about $57 million, or 57%, being provided by Aboriginal businesses.\"\n\nExploration\nTom Ormsby, claimed that \"The high quality of the Victor diamonds and the vastness of the Canadian shield points to great potential for another diamond mine being developed in northeastern Ontario.\" The \"Canadian Shield has great potential to host diamonds\" and potential in Canada \"appears to be at least twice as good as what southern Africa has held for potential for diamonds.\"\"There are approximately eight years remaining on the forecast life of mine for Victor.  In efforts to keep things going and extend this time frame, advanced exploration is currently underway at Victor on 15 previously identified diamond-bearing kimberlite pipes.\"\n\nEnvironmental and human concerns\nSo far, De Beers Canada employees and its contract partners have safely worked more than four million hours without a Lost Time Injury. Other human concerns are the mine's impact on the First Nations people and the company's pledge to help promote community growth will affect certain communities more than others.Concerns were brought up regarding the mine's impact on the surrounding area. Since it is an open pit mine it would disturb the natural environment. The impact area is 5,000 hectares of land. The first concern was raised in 2005, when environmental groups called on the Ontario government to perform its own environmental impact assessment aside from the Federal one as it was believed the Federal assessment did not fully assess the situation, including long term harm on the wildlife, wilderness and the water systems found there. However, the Project did receive an ISO 14001 certification.The environmental assessment process was later criticized for its restricted scope, namely for focusing primarily on the Attawapiskat First Nation, and largely excluding other potentially affected First Nations.\n\nAttawapiskat First Nation\nDe Beers Victor Diamond Mine is on Attawapiskat First Nation traditional land. An Impact-Benefit Agreement (IBA) was signed with community leaders in 2005 with Danny Metatawabin, acting as coordinator for the Impact-Benefit Agreement (IBA) between De Beers and Attawapiskat. Community members later protested the agreement through demonstrations and roadblocks claiming that the community's share of the \"bounty from the mine isn't getting back to the community.\" De Beers has negotiated a lease area. Although it is acknowledged that the mine is on Attawapiskat traditional land, the royalties from Victor Mine flow to the Government of Ontario, not Attawapiskat First Nation. As of 2015, De Beers was paying up to $2 million per year to Attawapiskat.  That payment is split between a trust fund controlled by the chief and council and the rest, which is used for community development and to pay Attawapiskat members who manage the band\u2019s impact benefit agreement with De Beers, says Attawapiskat member Charlie Hookimaw.\nThe trust fund now totals $13 million. In 2014, the community received about $1 million; $480,000 went to business relations and $545,868 was spent on community development, Hookimaw says. They have 500 full-time employees with 100 from Attawapiskat First Nation. De Beers also employs Attawapiskat First Nation in winter road construction. The \"mine employs 100 people from Attawapiskat at any one time. It generates about $400 million in annual revenue for the company.\" Sub-contractors from Attawapiskat First Nation also work for the mine.\"A federal review of the relationship between De Beers' Victor mine and Attawapiskat showed that government support for training and capacity did not start soon enough to deal with the huge lack of skills in the First Nation.\"\"Training is carried out on a year-round basis at the Victor Mine site as well as at the De Beers Canada Training Facility in Attawapiskat.\"\n\nSee also\nDe Beers\nList of diamond mines\nLake Timiskaming kimberlite field\nNorthern Ontario\nPassage 2:\nDry Fork Mine\nThe Dry Fork mine is a coal mine located 8 miles north of Gillette, Wyoming in the United States in the coal-rich Powder River Basin. The mine is an open pit mine that utilizes truck and shovel mining method to mine a low-sulfur, sub-bituminous coal that is used for domestic energy generation and shipped to customers via railroad. In 2011, the mine began supplying coal to the newly constructed Dry Fork power station that was constructed adjacent to the mine. The mine is currently owned and operated by Western Fuels Association.As of 2009, Dry Fork had reserves of 330 mm tons of sub-bituminous coal and a maximum permitted production capacity of 15mm tons per year. Typical annual production has been in 5.2mm ton range for the last several years though. In 2008, the mine produced just over 5.2 million short tons of coal, making it the 37th-largest producer of coal in the United States.The average quality of the coal shipped from Dry Fork is 8,050-8,200 BTU/lb, 0.20-0.42% Sulfur, 3.8-5.1% Ash, and 1.50% Sodium (of the ash). Train loading operations at the mine are done with a batch weigh bin system that is coupled to a \"weigh-in-motion\" track scale system. Silo capacity at the mine's rail loop, which can accommodate a single unit train, is 10,800 tons.\n\nHistory\nThe Dry Fork mine shipped its first coal to members of the Western Fuels Association in 1990 and is run by Western Fuels-Wyoming an associate of Western Fuels. Since opening, Dry Fork has shipped 69.5mm tons of coal.\n\nProduction\nPassage 3:\nTundra Mine\nThe Tundra Mine is a gold mine that operated in the Northwest Territories, of Canada between 1962 and 1968, producing 104,476 troy ounces (3,249.6 kg) of gold, from 187,714 tons of ore. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada has a project to remediate the Tundra Mine site under their Northern Contaminants Program, funded by the Canadian Federal Contaminated Sites Action Plan.\n\nExternal links\nTundra Mine: Indian and Northern Affairs Canada\nPassage 4:\nFranklin-Creighton Mine\nThe Franklin-Creighton Mine was a Georgia Gold Rush gold mine located off what is now Yellow Creek Road in the town of Ball Ground in Cherokee County, Georgia.  The mine, located along the Etowah River, was initially known as the Franklin Mine because it was started by a widow, Mrs. Mary G. Franklin, who obtained a 40-acre (160,000 m2) lot in the Gold Lottery of 1832.   Around 1883, the mine became known as the Creighton Mine or the Franklin-Creighton Mine.  This mine was one of the most productive and continued to operate many years after other area mines had ceased operations.  Some estimate that it was yielding $1000 per day in 1893 and others place its total production after 1880 at as much as $1,000,000.  The mine was shut down in 1913 as a result of a collapsed shaft which caused the mine to flood. As of 2022, only three major structures exist: The stamping mill's concrete foundation (which has been rebuilt into a pavilion for the nearby housing development site), the Franklin residence and doctor's office, and the \"Shingle House,\" the mine's former post office and general store.\n\nSources\nA Brief History of Cherokee County (accessed December 4, 2006)\nGeorgia Historical Marker \u2013 Cherokee County Gold (accessed December 4, 2006)\nPassage 5:\nTundra Mine/Salamita Mine Aerodrome\nTundra Mine/Salamita Mine Aerodrome (TC LID: CTM7) is a registered aerodrome that served the Tundra and Salmita Mines in the Northwest Territories, Canada.\nPassage 6:\nRaspadskaya coal mine\nThe Raspadskaya Coal Mine is a coal mine located in Mezhdurechensk, Kemerovo Oblast, Russia. It is the largest coal and the largest underground mine in Russia. The mine was opened in 1973 and its construction was completed in 1977. In addition to the main underground mine, the mining complex also includes MUK-96 underground mine, Raspadskaya Koksovaya underground mine, and Razrez Raspadsky open-pit mine, as also the Raspadskaya preparation plant. The mine is the largest coal mine in Russia.Raspadskaya's total resources were estimated at 1,461 million tons and total coal reserves at 782 million ton (JORC standards, according to IMC Consulting report as of June 2006, of which 22 million tons produced by 31 March 2008). Based on the volume produced in 2007, reserves-to-production ratio amounts to about 55 years of production. The complex produces 10% of Russia's coking coal.The mine is owned and operated by Raspadskaya OAO, a Russian publicly listed coal company.\nIn March 2001, a methane explosion killed four miners and injured six. The mine was shut down for two weeks in 2008 due to safety violations and a worker was killed after part of the mine collapsed in January 2010. On 8 May 2010, an explosion occurred killing 66 workers.In 2022, a remote sensing satellite found that the mine was releasing 87 metric tons, or 95 short tons, of methane each hour. Scientists who study methane leakage said the size was unprecedented. By contrast, the worst rate that occurred at the Aliso Canyon gas leak in California was 60 metric tons an hour.\nPassage 7:\nSalmita Mine\nThe Salmita Mine was a gold producer in the Northwest Territories, Canada during 1983 to 1987. The deposit was first discovered in 1945 and underground exploration was carried out in 1951\u20131952. It was reactivated for exploration by Giant Yellowknife Mines Limited in 1975 and entered production in 1983. They used the old camp and milling plant of the abandoned Tundra Mine, located a few kilometres to the south. The mine produced 179,906 troy ounces (5,595.7 kg) of gold from the milling of 238,177 tons of ore.\nThe area is now owned by Seabridge Gold.\nPassage 8:\nColomac Mine\nThe Colomac Mine was a privately owned and operated open pit gold mine located 200 km northwest of Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories in Canada . The Colomac mine operated between 1990\u20131992, and 1994\u20131997. It was operated by Neptune Resources Limited that had little success in making a profit during its operation. In 1994, the mine had reopened under Royal Oak Mines Inc. Both Neptune Resources and Royal Oak Mines where both owned and operated by Peggy Witte.  Due to low gold prices and high cost of mining, Royal Oak Mines was forced into bankruptcy. The Federal Government of Canada became owners of the mine, along with the related environmental issues. A major cleanup effort was completed to prevent the mine from polluting the environment. On January 26, 2012, Nighthawk Gold Corporation completed an agreement to acquire 100% of the mineral claims and leases of the former producing Colomac Gold Mine and surrounding mineral leases (Colomac Property), from then Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC) now Crown Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC). The Colomac Property lies within the central portion of Nighthawk Gold\u2019s 930 square kilometre property. Nighthawk Gold has since been responsibly exploring and advancing the Colomac Gold Project with the goal to restart gold mining operations in the future, assuming positive economics and the receipt of operating permits.\n\nProduction\nThe Colomac Mine processed a total of almost 12,300 Megagrams of ore, and produced 16.7 Megagrams (535,708 troy ounces) of gold, with an approximate value of $916 million. This figure is based on 2012 gold prices, averaging close to USD $55,000 per kg.\nIn April 2007, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada engaged the Professional Services company Deloitte & Touche LLP to become their solicitor, in order to find another independently-owned and -operated company to acquire the idle mine as well as the resources on the land it occupied. To generate interest, they featured the mine as  holding 6.6 Teragrams of untapped resources, a gold processing mill and related equipment, a maintenance building, a dorm room styled housing complex, power and fuel storage facilities, and mobile equipment (rock trucks, excavators and loaders). It was also featured on the popular reality television show Ice Road Truckers.\n\nCleanup\nAfter being shut down in 1997 and abandoned shortly after by Royal Oak Mines, it transferred into the Canadian Government's hands and responsibility in mid-December 1999. In accordance with water licensing laws and regulations in Canada, Royal Oak Mines had posted a $1.5 million security deposit and in 1999 they were charged with cyanide dumping by the Federal Government. The government of Canada had estimated the cost of the cleanup at $70 million due to high levels of cyanide and ammonia content, as well as acid mine drainage.\nFor the people of Indian Lake the tailing pond owned by the mine was at one stage threatening to overflow unless immediate action was taken to prevent a disastrous environmental impact.  A public hearing was called to cancel the mines' license and to begin a cleanup.\nIn 1999, the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND) awarded a one-year, $2 million contract to a consortium of aboriginal businesses from Deton\u00c7ho Corporation, the Dogrib Rae Band and the North Slave M\u00e9tis Alliance to undertake final reclamation activities at the Colomac Mine. The consortium conducted studies into contamination and took responsibility for on-going environmental monitoring and maintenance of the site. After the contract was awarded, Royal Oak Mine was finally charged under the Water Act and the Fisheries Act for the pollution it had  caused, this was much too late, since the company was already in receivership.\nAccording to MineWatch Canada in a 2001 publication:\n\"Now, the water license has not been changed, the money needed to clean-up the site is not forthcoming, and the Dogribs are faced with a potential catastrophe if the tailings pond overflows. Says Dogrib leader Ted Blondin: \"I think there is a fiduciary responsibility that the federal government has to looking after the Dogrib interests, and these are the arguments that we will use towards ensuring that the quality of water and the work that has to be done for the cleanup is done.\"During the initial cleanup phase, many new and effective remediation procedures where developed and put into place, including the use of farmed micro-organisms to remove hydrocarbons from soil contaminated by poor management of the fuel tank farm located on site.\nOn 25 February 2010 a $19 million contract was awarded to two aboriginal firms, Tlicho Engineering/Environmental Services Ltd and Aboriginal Engineering Ltd for a final two year remediation contract, which will also create local jobs in the area. According to Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada this two year remediation will cover:\n\"final remediation of the site, including: major demolition activities (primary and secondary crushing facilities, mill complex, maintenance shop and camp); hydrocarbon remediation (restoration of Steeve's Lake shoreline, free product recovery and soil treatment); site restoration (Truck Lake channel construction, stream crossing restoration) and capping of the non-hazardous landfill sites as well as continued provision of site services and maintenance. The contract, which follows a competitive process, will last until April of 2012 when the companies will conduct a full and final demobilization of the site.\"\nIn May 2010, officials suspended the remediation project due to an accident, which occurred at mine in April 2010. It occurred after a foremen working for Aboriginal Engineering Ltd suffered leg injuries after a 2.5 cm cable snapped. Human Resources and Skills Canada announced in May 2010 that they would not allow this remediation to continue until Aboriginal Engineering Ltd set out to implement the standards for health and safety set out by the Federal Government in relation to this type of task.\nPassage 9:\nMurowa diamond mine\nThe Murowa diamond mine is a diamond mine located in Mazvihwa, south central Zimbabwe, about 40 kilometres from the asbestos mining town of Zvishavane in the Midlands province. The mine is majority owned and operated by the Rio Tinto Group, which also owns the Argyle diamond mine in Australia and part of the Diavik Diamond Mine in Canada. The mine is a combination of open pit and underground construction; current estimates put construction costs at $61 million USD and mine reserves are 19 million tonnes of ore, with an ore grade of 0.9 carats (180 mg) per tonne.\n\nGeology of the Deposit\nMurowa consists of three north-trending kimberlite pipes, intrusive into the Chivi suite granites of the Zimbabwe Craton. The kimberlites have been dated at 500 Ma.\n\nHistory\nThe Murowa site's possibilities were first realized in 1997 when three diamond-bearing kimberlite pipes were discovered; over a period of three years of study, the two larger pipes have been determined to be economically feasible as mines. Construction of mine facilities was completed in late 2004. Preparation for mining included the forced relocation of 926 people living on the mine site to six farms purchased by a government relocation program. Limited mining operations began in Murowa in 2004, with full capacity expected to be reached sometime in 2005, although permitting problems have slowed progress toward this milestone. Full-scale production is expected to process 200,000 tonnes of ore annually, although it is possible to push production to as much as one million tonnes annually through further capital investment.\nThe mine is a combination of open pit and underground construction; current estimates put construction costs at $61 million USD. Current estimates of mine reserves are 19 million tonnes of ore, with an ore grade of 0.9 carats (180 mg) per tonne. Rio Tinto estimates that over the life of the mine, prices for the Murowa's production will fetch an average price of $65 USD per carat (325 $/g).\nPassage 10:\nNegus Mine\nNegus Mine was a gold producer at Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada, from 1939 to 1952. It produced 255,807 troy ounces (7,956.5 kg) of gold from 490,808 tons of ore milled. The underground workings were acquired by adjacent Con Mine in 1953 and were used for ventilation purposes until Con Mine closed in 2003.", "answers": ["yes"], "incorrect_answer": "No"}, {"input": "Which genus is native to arid or semi-desert areas, Alopecurus or Echeveria?", "context": "Passage 1:\nEcheveria\nEcheveria is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae, native to semi-desert areas of Central America, Mexico and northwestern South America.\n\nDescription\nPlants may be evergreen or deciduous. Flowers on short stalks (cymes) arise from compact rosettes of succulent fleshy, often brightly coloured leaves. Species are polycarpic, meaning that they may flower and set seed many times over the course of their lifetimes. Often numerous offsets are produced, and are commonly known as \"hen and chicks\", which can also refer to other genera, such as Sempervivum, that are significantly different from Echeveria. Many species of Echeveria serve important environmental roles, such as those of host plants for butterflies. For example, the butterfly Callophrys xami uses several species of Echeveria, such as Echevelia gibbiflora, for suitable host plants. Even more, these plants are integral to the oviposition process of C. xami and some other butterfly species as well.\n\nEtymology\nEcheveria is named for Atanasio Echeverr\u00eda y Godoy, a botanical illustrator who contributed to Flora Mexicana.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe genus was erected by A. P. de Candolle in 1828, and is named after the 18th century Mexican botanical artist Atanasio Echeverr\u00eda y Godoy. As of June 2018, the genus consists of about 150 species, including genera such as Oliveranthus and Urbinia that have formerly been split off from Echeveria. Molecular phylogenetic studies have repeatedly shown the genus not to be monophyletic: species of Echeveria cluster with species of Cremnophila, Graptopetalum, Pachyphytum, and Thompsonella as well as species of Sedum sect. Pachysedum. The former Urbinia species do appear to form a monophyletic group within this grouping. Although it is clear that Echeveria is not monophyletic, its limits are not clear, and further analyses are needed to determine whether and how the genus should be split, or if it should be included in an expanded concept of Sedum.\n\nSpecies\nThe International Crassulaceae Network accepts the following species:\n\nCultivation\nMany Echeveria species are popular as ornamental garden plants. They are drought-resistant, although they do better with regular deep watering and fertilizing. Most will tolerate shade and some frost, although hybrids tend to be less tolerant. Most lose their lower leaves in winter; as a result, after a few years, the plants lose their compact appearance and need to be re-rooted or propagated. In addition, if not removed, the shed leaves may decay, harboring fungus that can then infect the plant.\n\nPropagation\nThey can be propagated easily by separating offsets, but also by leaf cuttings, and by seed if they are not hybrids.\n\nCultivars and Hybrids\nEcheveria has been extensively bred and hybridized. The following is a selection of available plants.\n\nAward winning\nThe following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society\u2019s Award of Garden Merit:\n\nFormerly in Echeveria\nDudleya \u2013 Alwin Berger placed this as a subtaxon of Echeveria, and species within were described as Echeveria.\nGraptopetalum paraguayense (N.E.Br.)

It is found in semi-desert and arid bushveld, and in the west it occurs commonly in areas which are otherwise sparsely wooded. It is known for the particularly unpleasant smell of its flowers which appear during early spring, to which its specific name foetida alludes. Its freshly cut wood likewise has an unpleasant smell, and has traditional medicinal and magical uses, for instance as a protection against lightning. In central Botswana the village of Mopipi is named after this species.\n\nDescription\nHabit\nIt has several or many stems in the west, but is often single-stemmed in the east. It has a flattish, spreading crown, and is densely branched with some branches ending in spines. In Namibia it is often a shrub measuring about 1 m tall and 3 m wide, but it may also be a tree of up to 3 meters or over. It is similar to the closely related B. albitrunca, which is however distinguishable from most subspecies by its discolorous and distinctly larger leaves, and its smooth fruit. It may also be confused with Maerua parvifolia.\n\nBark\nThe smooth bark is pale grey to grey, with darker bark exposed in the fissures. Young branchlets have grey bark with a plum-coloured underlayer.\n\nFoliage\nThe shortly petiolate leaves are arranged in tight clusters on little knobs. The small, hard leaves usually measure less than 8 mm in length, but rarely up to 13 mm. They are grey-green in colour, concolorous in the west and discolorous in the east, and appear dark green from a distance. Foliage is browsed by game and livestock.\n\nFlowers\nThe small, greenish flowers lack petals but have prominent stamens, and a gynophore which equals the ovary and style in length. They are clustered in axillary racemes or may be reduced to axillary fascicles. They emit a rancid odour, after which the tree is named. Birds may feed on the flowers or use it as nesting material.\n\nFruit\nIt produces abundant globose fruit in summer that ripen to a yellowish or pale-brown colour. They have a velvet-textured exterior, as opposed to those of B. albitrunca, which are smooth. They are about 1 cm in diameter and are eaten by rodents, birds and people. The fruit usually contains a single brown seed.\n\nRange and habitat\nIt occurs in Namibia up to the Kunene region, the Northern Cape, central Botswana to southern Zimbabwe and the Transvaal bushveld and lowveld, eastern Eswatini, KwaZulu-Natal southwards to the Tugela valley, and in southernmost Mozambique. It grows mainly on plains in semi-desert or arid bushveld. It is also present on hillsides, rocky outcrops, termite mounds or along dry river courses. It grows on rocky, stony or gravel substrates in the west, and is absent from sand except where a rocky substrate is present.\n\nSubspecies\nThere are five subspecies:\n\nBoscia foetida subsp. filipes (Gilg) M.C.L\u00f6tter \u2013 Sandveld shepherd's treeRange: northern Limpopo, northern KZN, eastern Eswatini and southern Mozambique\nDescription: Up to 4 m tall shrub with greyish to yellowish-green bark, leaves 1.2\u20133.4 cm, somewhat shiny above and dull below, alternate or in fascicles of up to 4, petiole 1\u20132 mm long, flowers with 6\u20138 stamens and pedicels up to 7 mmBoscia foetida subsp. foetida Schinz \u2013 Stink shepherd's treeRange: Namibia to Northern Cape, South Africa\nDescription: Branches from ground level, leaves very small and concolorous, flowers with 11\u201315 stamensBoscia foetida subsp. longipedicellata (Gilg) Toelken \u2013 Tugela shepherd's treeRange: Tugela valley in central KwaZulu-Natal\nDescription: Single-stemmed up to 1 m, and large-leaved (1\u20133.5 cm), flowers with 11\u201315 stamens, long and slender flower stalks (for which it is named)Boscia foetida subsp. minima (Gilg) M.C.L\u00f6tter \u2013 Dwarf shepherd's treeRange: South Africa.

The sand tampan is an ectoparasite on humans, their livestock and wild animals, including birds and bats. Occurring in semi-desert areas of Africa, Saudi Arabia and other parts of the Persian Gulf, India, Sri Lanka and into Asia, it is able to survive for lengthy periods without feeding, spending most of its life burrowed under sand or loose soil, often in wait for animals that rest or sleep under trees or in the lee of rocks, but also in places where people or their animals congregate such as marketplaces, places of worship, cattle kraals and village squares. The timing of its activity is geared to coincide with that of potential hosts, but hot sunny conditions are usually avoided. Because of its habit of feeding and dropping from its host, adult dispersal is limited, whereas larvae may remain attached to their hosts for several days. During its life cycle it will feed on multiple hosts between moults.This species is of interest because of the pathogens it carries, and its salivary apyrases which prevent platelet activation and aggregation, that is, blood-clotting. In humans the tick may cause dermatitis, fever and lymphadenitis. It is also a carrier of Borrelia, a spirochaete bacterium, and is a carrier of a flavivirus causing Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever (AHFV). The closely related Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV) is endemic to certain regions of India. That AHFV and KFDV diverged some 700 years ago would suggest that unknown tick-borne hemorrhagic/encephalitic viruses may exist between Saudi Arabia and India.Soft ticks of the family Argasidae lack the hard scutum or shield present in hard ticks of the family Ixodidae. Their gnathosoma or mouth structure is located on the underside of the body and is not readily visible. Their feeding method differs from that of the hard ticks in that they do not embed a capitulum in the host, but make an incision through the skin and sip the oozing blood. The feeding lasts up to 30 minutes during which time their body weight may increase as much as tenfold. Sand tampans by their concerted attack in large numbers are able to paralyse and kill sizeable mammals, especially penned livestock, by introducing toxins during feeding, mainly through coxal gland secretions, leading to symptoms similar to those of anaphylactic shock in older animals. These toxins affect the cardiac system, causing Mobitz type atrial-ventricular blocks and ventricular tachycardia. The defensins employed by O. savignyi are being studied for developing multifunctional peptides - shorter peptides derived from the defensin isoform 2 (OsDef2) have useful antibacterial, antioxidant, and cytotoxic properties.Ornithodoros spp are found worldwide in semi-arid regions, living in burrows, caves, dens, cliffsides, and bird colonies. O. savignyi and O. coriaceus are exceptional in having eyes. O. coriaceus occurs under hillside scrub oak from northern California and Nevada to Mexico, in deer beds under trees and in the lee of large rocks. O. gurneyi favours tree-shaded sand in the deserts of Australia, resting places of kangaroos and people. O. porcinus is found on warthogs, bushpigs and other pig species and occurs throughout Africa in suitable habitats - it plays a role in transmitting the virus causing African swine fever which in 2013 was found 35 km north of Pretoria. A salticid spider, Phidippus rimator, has been recorded from northern California as predating Ornithodoros coriaceus and is only the second predator recorded for this species.O. savignyi was named after the zoologist Marie Jules C\u00e9sar Lelorgne de Savigny, a contemporary of Jean Victoire Audouin's.\nSince they are attracted by carbon dioxide, dry ice may be used for their collection, or they may be sifted from the soil. Ornithodoros tampans also fluoresce under ultraviolet light.\n\nDistribution\nThe extensive distribution of this species from Africa to Asia strongly suggests anthropogenic origins. \"Dispersal of the ancestral viruses of AHFV and KFDV may have been accomplished through the movement of animals, including camels presumably carrying ticks, along the Silk Road, which by the 1300s stretched from Europe to China.\"\n\nMating behaviour\nThe coxal secretion of adult female ticks, appearing during and after a blood meal, contains a sex pheromone provoking a mating response from males. Mating occurs off the host, hard ticks doing so on the host animal. Females lay a few hundred eggs in several batches, and may do so for several seasons\u2014adults of Ornithodoros erraticus can live for 15\u201320 years (Encinas Grandes et al. 1993).  There is little seasonal fluctuation in their numbers as their microhabitats are quite stable.\n\nChemical and vaccine control\nAttempted chemical control of tampans by poisoning leads inevitably to their acquiring resistance and immunity to the drugs used. The long-term damage done to the environment by use of such chemicals outweighs any short-term benefits that may accrue. Natural controls in the form of pathogens, predators and parasites are sufficient to curb tampan numbers.\nA final possibility for the control of O. erraticus is the use of tick vaccines, the basic principle of which is to stimulate the host immune system to produce a response which damages feeding ticks (Manzano-Rom\u00e1n et al. 2012a). This approach has been successful against hard ticks, and two recombinant anti-hard tick vaccines are currently available commercially (de la Fuente et al. 2007, Willadsen 2008). To date, attempts to develop anti-Ornithodoros vaccines have focused on either salivary gland antigens or gut antigens as candidate targets (Manzano-Rom\u00e1n et al. 2012a). Although experiments using salivary gland proteins achieved mixed results, an approach using gut antigens was more promising, inducing a protective response in pigs, decreasing female fecundity in 50% and causing up to 80% mortality in nymphs (Manzano-Rom\u00e1n et al. 2012a)\nPassage 4:\nEcheveria elegans\nEcheveria elegans, the Mexican snow ball, God's Throne, Mexican gem or white Mexican rose is a species of flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae, native to semi-desert habitats in Mexico.\n\nDescription\nEcheveria elegans is a succulent evergreen perennial growing to 5\u201310 cm (2\u20134 in) tall by 50 cm (20 in) wide, with tight rosettes of pale green-blue fleshy leaves, bearing 25 cm (10 in) long slender pink stalks of pink flowers with yellow tips in winter and spring.\n\nCultivation\nEcheveria elegans is cultivated as an ornamental plant for rock gardens planting, or as a potted plant. It thrives in subtropical climates, such as Southern California\nIt has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.Like others of its kind, it produces multiple offsets which can be separated from the parents in spring, and grown separately - hence the common name \"hen and chicks\", applied to several species within the genus Echeveria.\n\nEtymology\nEcheveria is named for Atanasio Echeverr\u00eda y Godoy, a botanical illustrator who contributed to Flora Mexicana.Elegans means 'elegant' or 'graceful'.\nPassage 5:\nGround jay\nThe ground jays or ground choughs belong to a distinct group of the passerine order of birds in the genus Podoces of the crow family Corvidae. They inhabit high altitude semi-desert areas from central Asia to Mongolia.\nGround jays show adaptations to ground living such as long, strong legs adapted to fast running and the ability to leap and bound onto boulders and rocks with great agility. Their long, curved thick bills are adapted for digging and probing.\nWhile capable of flight (which they do infrequently and relatively weakly), they prefer running, and will readily perch on trees and bushes also.\n\nSpecies list\nThe ground tit (Pseudopodoces humilis), previously Hume's ground jay, has changed its placement within the Passeriformes recently because of molecular and osteological testing. It has now been placed into the Paridae.\nPassage 6:\nMulga Island\nMulga Island is a small island 5.6 kilometres (3 nmi) off the coast and 9.3 kilometres (5 nmi) northeast of Kirkby Head, Enderby Land in Antarctica. Plotted from air photos taken from ANARE (Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions) aircraft in 1956. Mulga is the vernacular name for species of Acacia found in semi-desert areas of Australia.\n\nSee also\nList of Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islands This article incorporates public domain material from \"Mulga Island\".

Like other breeds of Turkmen horse, it is named for the Turkmen tribe that raised it, the Iomud. Both the name of the horse and the name of the Turkmen clan may be spelt in many ways, including Iomud, Yomud, Yamud and Yomut. The Iomud horse is raised in Turkmenistan, particularly in the velayat of Da\u015foguz; in Uzbekistan; in Karakalpakstan (now part of Uzbekistan), particularly in the Khwarezm region; and in Iraq, Iran and Turkey.:\u200a30\u200a Unlike the Akhal-Teke, it usually kept in herds in desert or semi-desert areas.:\u200a297\n\nHistory\nLike other breeds of Turkmen horse \u2013 including the Akhal-Teke, the Ersari, the Goklan, the Salor and the Sarik \u2013 the Iomud breed is named for the Turkmen tribe that formed it, the Iomud. The Iomud people occupy the northern part of modern Turkmenistan, from the eastern shores of the Caspian Sea in the west to the area of Da\u015foguz, on the northern edge of the Karakum Desert, in the north-east. They are principally concentrated in the velayats of Balkan and Da\u015foguz,:\u200a30\u200a and this is considered the area of origin of the Iomud horse.:\u200a297\u200aThe early history of the Iomud breed, like that of Turkmen horses in general, is not clear. The qualities of Turkmen horses, and the differences between the various breeds, were recognised by western travellers in the area in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Clement Augustus de Bode wrote in 1848 that the Tekke horses had the best endurance, and were preferred to pure-bred Arabs, while the Iomud and the Goklan were faster and more lightly built.In the twentieth century, numbers of the Iomud breed declined. In 1980, in the Soviet era, the total number was recorded as 964, of which 616 were considered pure-bred. In 1983 stud farms were set up with the aim of increasing the number of breeding mares from 140 to about 250.  A conservation farm was also established in the Gyzyletrek district, in south-west Turkmenistan.:\u200a297\u200aThe Iomud contributed significantly to the development of the Lokai breed in Tajikistan.:\u200a88\n\nCharacteristics\nIomud horses have remarkable endurance. According to local information collected in 1937, they could cover the 800 km from Da\u015foguz to Etrek in seven days. They can carry 120 kg without difficulty in mountain or desert terrain.:\u200a31\u200aIomud horses are usually grey or chestnut; golden chestnut and black can occur. Stallions stand about 152 cm (15 hands), mares a little less. Thoracic circumference (girth) is about 168 cm, cannon bone measurement about 19 cm. The profile is straight or slightly convex, the legs fine and often bowed; the mane and tail are sparse, and the skin is delicate.:\u200a297\nPassage 8:\nEcheveria setosa\nEcheveria setosa, the Mexican fire cracker, is a species of flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae, native to semi-desert areas of Mexico and common throughout Puebla.\n\nDescription\nEcheveria setosa is an evergreen succulent growing to 4 cm (2 in) high by 30 cm (12 in) wide, with spherical rosettes of fleshy spoon-shaped leaves covered in white hairs. These white hairs, known as glochids, can cause irritation to the skin if touched. In spring it bears 30 cm (12 in) long stalks of red flowers with yellow tips.\n\nTaxonomy\nEcheveria setosa var. ciliata (Moran) Moran 1993\nEcheveria setosa var. deminuta J.

It is grown outside in subtropical climates, such as Southern California. As it requires a minimum temperature of 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F), it must be grown under glass with heat in colder temperate regions. It can be placed outside during the summer months.\n\nEtymology\nEcheveria is named for Atanasio Echeverr\u00eda y Godoy, a botanical illustrator who contributed to Flora Mexicana.Setosa means 'covered with stiff, bristly hairs'.\nPassage 9:\nAgrotis orthogonia\nAgrotis orthogonia, the pale western cutworm, is a moth of the family Noctuidae. The species was first described by Herbert Knowles Morrison in 1876. It is found in North America, more specifically dry, semi-desert areas of western North America from southern Canada to California, ranging eastward nearly to the eastern edge of the Great Plains.\nThe wingspan is about 34 mm.\nThe larvae feed on various forbs and grasses. The species is occasionally of economic importance on winter wheat and small grains.  It has also been reported from corn and sugar beets.\n\nSubspecies\nAgrotis orthogonia delorata\nAgrotis orthogonia duae\nPassage 10:\nAlopecurus\nAlopecurus, or foxtail grass, is a common and widespread genus of plants in the grass family. It is common across temperate and subtropical parts of Eurasia, northern Africa, and the Americas, as well as naturalized in Australia and on various islands.Foxtails can be annual or perennial. They grow in tufts. They have flat leaves and blunt ligules (a small flap at the junction of leaf and stem). Their inflorescence is a dense panicle (a branching head without terminal flower) with 1-flowered spikelets. A few, particularly A. myosuroides, are considered weeds, others are very decorative and are used in bouquets of dried flowers.\n\nSpeciesAlopecurus aequalis \u2013 Orange foxtail, shortawn foxtail \u2013 Eurasia, Americas\nAlopecurus albovii \u2013 Caucasus\nAlopecurus anatolicus \u2013 eastern Turkey\nAlopecurus apiatus \u2013 Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran\nAlopecurus arundinaceus \u2013 Reed foxtail, creeping foxtail, creeping meadow foxtail  \u2013 Eurasia, North Africa\nAlopecurus aucheri \u2013 Caucasus, Turkey, Iran\nAlopecurus baptarrhenius \u2013 Ethiopia\nAlopecurus bonariensis \u2013 Argentina, Uruguay\nAlopecurus borii \u2013 Turkmenistan\nAlopecurus bornmuelleri \u2013 Palestine\nAlopecurus brachystachus \u2013 Russia, China, Mongolia\nAlopecurus bulbosus \u2013 Bulbous foxtail \u2013 Mediterranean, western Europe\nAlopecurus carolinianus \u2013 tufted meadow foxtail \u2013 US, western Canada\nAlopecurus creticus \u2013 Greece, Turkey, Balkans\nAlopecurus dasyanthus \u2013 Caucasus, Iran\nAlopecurus davisii \u2013 Samos Island in Greece\nAlopecurus geniculatus \u2013  Bent foxtail, marsh meadow foxtail \u2013 Algeria, Eurasia\nAlopecurus gerardii \u2013 Mediterranean\nAlopecurus glacialis \u2013 Caucasus, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan\nAlopecurus \u00d7 haussknechtianus \u2013 central + northwestern Europe\nAlopecurus heliochloides \u2013 Chile\nAlopecurus himalaicus \u2013 Himalayas, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Central Asia, Xinjiang\nAlopecurus hitchcockii \u2013 Peru, Bolivia, Jujuy\nAlopecurus japonicus \u2013 China, Japan, Korea\nAlopecurus laguroides \u2013 Caucasus, Turkey\nAlopecurus lanatus \u2013 Turkey\nAlopecurus longiaristatus \u2013 Heilongjiang, Primorye, Khabarovsk\nAlopecurus magellanicus \u2013 northern Eurasia, North + South America, Falkland Is, South Georgia\nAlopecurus \u00d7 marssonii \u2013 Ukraine\nAlopecurus mucronatus \u2013 Iran, Afghanistan, Tajikistan\nAlopecurus myosuroides \u2013 Slender meadow foxtail, black grass, twitch grass, black twitch \u2013 Eurasia, North Africa\nAlopecurus nepalensis \u2013 Himalayas, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan\nAlopecurus \u00d7 plettkei \u2013 France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands\nAlopecurus ponticus \u2013 Caucasus\nAlopecurus pratensis \u2013 meadow foxtail \u2013 Eurasia from Azores to Mongolia\nAlopecurus rendlei \u2013 central + southern Europe, Algeria, Libya, Turkey\nAlopecurus saccatus \u2013 Pacific foxtail \u2013 United States (WA OR ID CA), Baja California\nAlopecurus setarioides \u2013 France, Greece, Italy, Balkans, Turkey\nAlopecurus textilis \u2013 Turkey, Caucasus, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Turkmenistan\nAlopecurus turczaninovii \u2013 Siberia\nAlopecurus \u00d7 turicensis \u2013 France, Switzerland\nAlopecurus utriculatus \u2013 Greece, Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Cyprus, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine\nAlopecurus vaginatus \u2013 Crimea, Caucasus, Turkey, Middle East, Iran, Afghanistan\nAlopecurus \u00d7 winklerianus \u2013 France, Switzerland, Germany, Polandformerly includedNumerous species once considered part of Alopecurus but now regarded as better suited to other genera: Agrostis Chaetopogon Cornucopiae Crypsis Koeleria Milium Muhlenbergia Pennisetum Perotis Phleum Polypogon Rostraria Setaria Tribolium\n\nSee also\nList of Poaceae genera", "answers": ["Echeveria"], "incorrect_answer": "Boscia"}, {"input": "Are Euptelea and Muehlenbeckia both genuses?", "context": "Passage 1:\nEuptelea pleiosperma\nEuptelea pleiosperma is a species of plant in the family Eupteleaceae. It is found in China, India, and Myanmar.\nPassage 2:\nPeristoreus viridipennis\nPeristoreus viridipennis is a species of true weevil. It is endemic to New Zealand. It is associated with plants of the genus Muehlenbeckia.P. viridipennis was originally named Erirhinus viridipennis by Broun in 1880. Then, in 1926, Marshall described a new genus called Dorytomodes, into which he provisionally transferred all species placed by Broun in Erirrhinus [=Erirhinus]. Dorytomodes was subsequently sunk as a synonym of Peristoreus by Edwin S. (\"Ted\") Gourlay in 1950.\nPassage 3:\nPeristoreus fulvus\nPeristoreus fulvus is a species of true weevil. It is endemic to New Zealand. It is associated with plants of the genus Muehlenbeckia.P. fulvus was originally named Erirhinus fulvus by Broun in 1886. Then, in 1926, Marshall described a new genus called Dorytomodes, into which he provisionally transferred all species placed by Broun in Erirrhinus [=Erirhinus]. Dorytomodes was subsequently sunk as a synonym of Peristoreus by Edward S. (\"Ted\") Gourlay in 1950.\nPassage 4:\nMuehlenbeckia ephedroides\nMuehlenbeckia ephedroides, the leafless pohuehue or leafless muehlenbeckia, is a prostrate or climbing plant native to New Zealand.\n\nDescription\nMuehlenbeckia ephedroides are grey-green, grey to grey-black in colour. The stem is branched and is 1 millimetre (0.039 in) in diameter. It is also flexuous, striate, puberulent, and is grey to grey-black or grey-green in colour. The leaves are of the same colour, are glabrous and are 5\u201325 millimetres (0.20\u20130.98 in) long. Inflorescence is fascicled or racimed with pale pedicels that are 1\u20131.5 millimetres (0.039\u20130.059 in) long. Flowers have a pistillate and are staminate as well. Lobes are narrow-triangular, and are either white, pale yellow-green or just green in colour. Stigmas are obovoid trigonous and are 1.5 millimetres (0.059 in) long. They have white coloured and succulent tepals that are swollen also. The twigs are leafless.\n\nHabitat\nIt grows at elevations of 0\u20131,200 metres (0\u20133,937 ft) in coastal or subalpine climates. It can be found growing near rivers, on beaches, sand spits, and alluvial fans.\nPassage 5:\nEuptelea\nEuptelea is a genus of two species of flowering plants in the monogeneric family Eupteleaceae.  The genus is found from Assam east through China to Japan, and consists of shrubs or small trees:\n\nEuptelea pleiosperma\nEuptelea polyandraThe genus was previously placed in the family Trochodendraceae, but the family Eupteleaceae has been recognized by many taxonomists. The APG IV system (2016; unchanged from the APG III system of 2009, the APG II system of 2003 and the APG system of 1998), recognizes it and places it in the order Ranunculales, in the clade eudicots. The family consists of a single genus Euptelea, with two species, native to eastern Asia.\nEuptelea polyandra is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the engrailed.\nThe flowers lack sepals and petals. The anthers are basifixed, and the leaves are arranged in whorls.The fossil range of the genus extends back to the Paleocene epoch, during much of the Cenozoic it was distributed widely over the Northern Hemisphere.\nPassage 6:\nMuehlenbeckia australis\nMuehlenbeckia australis, the large-leaved muehlenbeckia or pohuehue, is a prostrate or climbing plant native to New Zealand.\n\nDescription\nThe species grows up to 10 metres (33 ft) tall with grey bark. The leaves are on stiff petioles and are 25 millimetres (0.98 in) long. Lamina is 2\u20138 centimetres (0.79\u20133.15 in) by 1\u20133 centimetres (0.39\u20131.18 in) long.\nIt has juvenile and adult leaf forms and loses its leaves in winter. The flowers are greenish and the fruits are juicy with black shiny seeds covered by a white, succulent cup of sepals, which are fed on by various birds and lizards.\nFlowers bloom from late spring to autumn, with it panicles occur usually in spring and summer. Fruits are present from November to April, sometimes till June.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe species was first described in 1786 by Georg Forster, as Coccoloba australis. It was transferred to the genus Muehlenbeckia in 1841 by Carl Meissner. Some sources, including Plants of the World Online, regard Muehlenbeckia adpressa as a synonym of this species. Others treat them as separate species.\n\nEcology\nM. australis prefers places with plenty of sunlight and climbing support, such as forest edges, cliff faces, scrub and regenerating vegetation. With its climbing and rapid growth form, it is capable of engulfing roadside trees, and has benefited from cleared habitats created since human settlement began, and is sometimes the only native species present in such areas.\n\nHost plant\nM. australis is a host plant for numerous New Zealand endemic insects including Pyrgotis eudorana, Apoctena orthropis, Argosarchus horridus, and Clitarchus hookeri.\nPassage 7:\nMuehlenbeckia horrida subsp. abdita\nMuehlenbeckia horrida subsp. abdita (syn. Duma horrida subsp. abdita). commonly known as remote thorny lignum, is a critically endangered shrub endemic to Western Australia.\n\nDescription\nIt is an upright, spreading, leafless shrub, that grows to a height of from 60 to 120 centimetres. It has bright, light yellow clusters of flowers.\nThe subspecies was described in 1996 by Karen Wilson.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nMuehlenbckia horrida subsp. abdita is known only from two populations within the Lake Bryde-East Lake Bryde wetland, in the Western Mallee subregion of the Mallee region in the South West Botanical Province of Western Australia.\nIt grows in waterlogged silt and sand, on the beds of Lake Bryde and East Lake Bryde. It depends for its survival upon a regular cycle of freshwater flooding followed by drying of the lake bed.\n\nConservation\nPopulations of M. h. subsp. abdita have declined severely in the last thirty years, mainly because of increasing salinity. Salinity loads in the Lakes were measured at around 160 tonnes in 1985, but had increased to around 1200 tonnes in 2005. This increase is attributable to a rising water table caused by widespread clearing for agriculture. Other threats include interruption of the flooding/drying regime because of altered hydrology; and recreational activities such as water skiing. It is estimated that there are about 2000 plants left. There was previously a third population, but these were all dead in 2002, and the population is thought to be unrecoverable.It is listed as \"critically endangered\" under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and as \"Rare\" under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. The whole lake bed ecosystem has been classified as a critically endangered threatened ecological community under the name Bryde.\nPassage 8:\nMuehlenbeckia adpressa\nMuehlenbeckia adpressa, commonly known as climbing lignum, is a prostrate or climbing plant, native to Australia. It has thin red-brown stems up to 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) in length. The leaves are 1.5\u20136 centimetres (0.59\u20132.36 in) long and 1.5\u20133.5 centimetres (0.59\u20131.38 in) wide. It occurs in coastal areas of Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe species was first described in 1805 by Jacques Labillardi\u00e8re, as Polygonum adpressum. It was transferred to the genus Muehlenbeckia in 1843 by Carl Meissner. Some sources, including Plants of the World Online, regard M. adpressa as a synonym of M. australis. Others treat them as separate species.\n\nGallery\nPassage 9:\nMuehlenbeckia\nMuehlenbeckia or maidenhair is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the borders of the Pacific, including South and North America, Papua New Guinea and Australasia. It has been introduced elsewhere, including Europe. Species vary in their growth habits, many being vines or shrubs. In some environments, rampant species can become weedy and difficult to eradicate.\n\nDescription\nSpecies of Muehlenbeckia vary considerably in their growth habits; they may be perennials, vinelike, or shrubs. All have rhizomatous roots. Their leaves are arranged alternately on the stem, usually with stalks (petioles), but sometimes stalkless (sessile). The brownish ocrea is short and tubular, soon disintegrating. The inflorescences may be terminal or axillary, and are in the form of spikes or clusters, with at most very short peduncles (flowering stems). Individual flowers have pedicels (stalks). The flowers may be bisexual or unisexual, with sometimes a mixture of staminate, pistillate and bisexual flowers on the same plant. There are five white to greenish white tepals, joined at the base. Staminate flowers have 8 (sometimes 9) stamens and a rudimentary pistil. Pistillate flowers have rudimentary stamens and three spreading styles. The fruit is in the form of a black or dark brown unwinged achene, three-sided to more or less globe-shaped, at least partly enclosed by the persistent tepals.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe genus was erected by Carl Meissner in 1841, initially for two species that he distinguished from Coccoloba and Polygonum. The generic name honours Alsatian bryologist Heinrich Gustav M\u00fchlenbeck (1798\u20131845).Muehlenbeckia is placed in the tribe Polygoneae of the subfamily Polygonoideae. Within the tribe, it is most closely related to the genera Reynoutria and Fallopia s.s., forming the so-called \"RMF clade\".\n\nSpecies\nAs of March 2019, Plants of the World Online recognized 24 species (see note below):\n\nSome sources, including Plants of the World Online, regard M. adpressa as a synonym of M. australis. Others treat them as separate species.Three species have been transferred to the genus Duma:\nMuehlenbeckia coccoloboides J.M.Black \u2192 Duma coccoloboides\nMuehlenbeckia florulenta Meisn. \u2013 tangled lignum \u2192 Duma florulenta\nMuehlenbeckia horrida H.Gross \u2192 Duma horrida\n\nDistribution\nNative\n\nAustralasia:\nAustralia: Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Norfolk Island, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia\nNew Zealand: Chatham Islands, New Zealand North, New Zealand South\nPapuasia: New Guinea\nNeotropic:\nCentral America: Honduras\nSouthern South America: Chile\n\nInvasiveness\nAll members of the RMF clade appear to have the potential to become invasive, in some cases via vigorous hybrids. The highly invasive Japanese knotweed (Reynoutria japonica) hybridizes with Muehlenbeckia australis. The related Muehlenbeckia complexa has established populations in southern parts of Britain and in the Channel Islands, and is a problematic invasive species in the San Francisco area.\nPassage 10:\nMuehlenbeckia axillaris\nMuehlenbeckia axillaris (creeping wire vine, sprawling wire vine, matted lignum) is a low evergreen shrub, forming wiry mats up to about 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) in diameter, native to New Zealand, and the Australian states of Tasmania, New South Wales and Victoria. It has thin, red-brown stems, with glossy squarish to roundish leaves that are less than 1 cm (0.39 in) in diameter and 2\u20134 mm (0.079\u20130.157 in) thick. Flowers are inconspicuous, yellowish-white, 4\u20138 mm (0.16\u20130.31 in) in diameter, and borne in groups of up to three in the axils. The fruit is black, shiny, and up to 3.5 mm (0.14 in) long, produced in late summer to fall.\nThe plant is hardy, drought-tolerant, and quick-growing, thriving in a range of light conditions. It can be cultivated as a ground cover and grows well in rocky ground, as well as standard potting soil. Although it grows fastest in warm seasons, it tolerates freezing weather.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe species was first described by Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1847, who used the name \"Polygonum (Muhlenbeckia) axillaris\". Both Stephan Endlicher (in 1848) and Wilhelm Gerhard Walpers (in 1849) later referred to it as just Muehlenbeckia axillaris.\n\nSynonyms\nPseudanthus tasmanicus", "answers": ["yes"], "incorrect_answer": "No, they are not genuses."}, {"input": "What are some foods that may have been served at the Hawaiin Cottage?", "context": "Passage 1:\nElio Leoni Sceti\nElio Leoni Sceti is an Italian businessman and an investor in early-stage companies.

It may feature food such as poi, k\u0101lua pua\u02bba (k\u0101lua pig), poke, lomi salmon, \u02bbopihi, and haupia, beer, and entertainment such as traditional Hawaiian music and hula. Among people from Hawai\u02bbi, the concepts of \"l\u016b\u02bbau\" and \"party\" are often blended, resulting in graduation l\u016b\u02bbau, wedding l\u016b\u02bbau, baby l\u016b\u02bbau, and birthday l\u016b\u02bbau.\n\nHistory\nIn ancient Hawai\u02bbi, men and women ate meals separately. Additionally, commoners and women were not allowed to eat foods that were rarely eaten  or foods that were only served during special occasions. However, in 1819, King Kamehameha II removed all the religious laws that were practiced. King Kamehameha II performed a symbolic act by eating with the women, thus ending the Hawaiian religious kapu (taboo) system. This is when the l\u016b\u02bbau parties were first created.\n\nFood\nEarlier, such a feast was called a p\u0101\u02bbina or \u02bbaha\u02bbaina. The modern name comes from that of a food often served at a l\u016b\u02bbau: squid or chicken l\u016b\u02bbau, which consist of meat, l\u016b\u02bbau (or taro) leaves, and coconut milk. The main dish of the l\u016b\u02bbau is k\u0101lua pua\u02bba (k\u0101lua pig), slow-cooked in an imu (earth oven). Another dish that is served is poi, made from the roots of taro. This feast was usually served on the floor, on the mats often decorated with large centerpieces typically made of t\u012b leaves. Utensils were never present during a l\u016b\u02bbau; everything was eaten by hand. For example, varieties of poi were identified by the number of fingers needed to eat it: \"three-finger\", \"two-finger\", or the thickest, \"one-finger poi\".\nA traditional l\u016b\u02bbau consists of food such as:\n\nChicken long rice\nHaupia\n\u02bbUala (Hawaiian sweet potato)\nHawaiian sweet bread\nK\u0101lua pua\u02bba (Hawaiian roast pig)\nKulolo\nLaulau\nLomilomi salmon\nPoi\nPoke\nSquid l\u016b\u02bbau or chicken l\u016b\u02bbau\nTropical fruits\n\nL\u016b\u02bbau-themed parties\nL\u016b\u02bbau-themed or Hawaiian-themed parties vary in their range of dedication to Hawaiian traditions. For example, some extravagant affairs go so far as to ship food from the islands, while others settle for artificial lei, maitais, and a poolside atmosphere.To have a l\u016b\u02bbau-themed party, it is essential to have an open area, such as a backyard, because l\u016b\u02bbau are celebrated under large tents in outdoor areas. Also a lei is a very common item in a l\u016b\u02bbau. A lei is a necklace of flowers, ferns, or kukui nuts that men and women wear. At l\u016b\u02bbau-themed parties, the guests can make their own lei or they can be bought. At these types of parties entertainment is a must. The instruments used are typically the ukulele, guitar and sometimes drums. There are also often hula dancers.Some credit Donn Beach with the initial popularity and commercialization of l\u016b\u02bbaus within the continental United States.  A Life article from 1946 graphically displays one of his famous l\u016b\u02bbaus that he held in Encino, California. In a 1986 interview Beach described his role in shaping private, home based l\u016b\u02bbaus into larger public affairs, where he included entertainment from singers such as Alfred Apaka.\nPassage 3:\nPub cheese\nPub cheese is a type of soft cheese spread and dip prepared using cheese as a primary ingredient and usually with some type of beer or ale added. It can be made with smoked cheeses or liquid smoke added to impart a smoky flavor.  It is typically served with crackers or vegetables, whereby the cheese is spread onto these foods, or the foods may be dipped in it. It is also used as a topping on sandwiches, such as hamburgers. Pub cheese is a traditional bar snack in the United States.Pub cheese is sometimes prepared using a mix of processed cheese and pure cheese.It is a mass-produced product in the United States. For example, Pr\u00e9sident is a brand that includes pub cheese in its line, and Trader Joe's has a store brand of pub cheese.Some bars, breweries, public houses and restaurants produce their own versions of pub cheese.\n\nSee also\nPassage 4:\nUniversity station (CTA)\nUniversity was a station on the Chicago Transit Authority's Green Line; The station was located at 1200 East 63rd Street in the Woodlawn neighborhood of Chicago. University opened on April 23, 1893. From December 12, 1982, until January 9, 1994, University served as the terminal of the Jackson Park Branch. The station closed on January 9, 1994, when the entire Green Line closed for a renovation project. University did not reopen with the rest of the Green Line on May 12, 1996. University was scheduled to be replaced by a new terminal at Dorchester. Instead the line was cut back to its current terminal at Cottage Grove. The University station was demolished in September 1997 when the City of Chicago demolished the rest of the Jackson Park branch east of Cottage Grove.\nPassage 5:\nBeurre Ma\u00eetre d'H\u00f4tel\nBeurre ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel, also referred to as ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel butter, is a type of compound butter (French: \"beurre compos\u00e9\") of French origin, prepared with butter, parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper. It is a savory butter that is used on meats such as steak (including the sauce for Chateaubriand steak), fish, vegetables and other foods. It may be used in place of a sauce, and can significantly enhance a dish's flavor. Some variations with a sweet flavor exist. It is usually served cold as sliced disks on foods, and is sometimes served as a side condiment.\n\nEtymology\nThe name of beurre ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel is derived from the manner in which it was commonly prepared from scratch by a restaurant's ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel at diners' tables. It is also referred to as ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel butter.\n\nPreparation\nBeurre ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel is a savory butter prepared by mixing softened butter with very finely minced parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper. A ratio of around 1.5 tablespoons of parsley to two ounces of butter may be used. Additional ingredients may include shallot and Worcestershire sauce. Vinegar is sometimes used, although its inclusion is rare. Cayenne pepper has also been used. After mixing, it is typically rolled in parchment paper or plastic wrap and chilled to harden.\n\nUses\nBeurre ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel is usually served cold as sliced disks atop various foods, and sometimes as a side condiment. It is used on grilled meats such as steak and fish, and also on eggs, vegetables, potatoes and breads. Some variations exist, including a few sweet versions that include sugar, which may be used on dishes such as pancakes. When used as a topping, it is typically added just before the dish is served. It has also been served melted atop dishes, whereby it is placed atop foods during the last few minutes of cooking. It may be used in the place of a sauce, and a small amount can significantly add to a dish's overall flavor.\n\nIn Chateaubriand sauce\nBeurre ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel is used as an ingredient in Chateaubriand sauce, which is sometimes used in the preparation of Chateaubriand steak. The butter is used in the last stage of the sauce's preparation, whereby after the sauce is strained, it is finished with beurre ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel. Chopped tarragon may also be added to the sauce during this last preparation stage.\n\nSee also\nNotes\nPassage 6:\nGeoff Beattie\nWilliam Geoffrey Beattie (born 1960) is a Canadian business executive and former lawyer.

The restaurant's exterior was known for its vivid yellow, pineapple-shaped dome, burning Polynesian torches at the entrance, and a Hawaiian atmosphere that included a luau show. After Mr. Egidi's death in a car accident in the early 1940s, Mrs. Egidi continued to operate the business. Her second husband, John Muresan, helped with the restaurant's growth. On July 1, 1978, the restaurant was destroyed by a fire.Both John and Mary Muresan died in 1997.\nPassage 8:\nA-ration\nThe A-ration (officially Field Ration, Type A) is a United States military ration consisting of fresh, refrigerated, or frozen foods. A-rations may be served in dining facilities, prepared in the field using field kitchens, or prepared at a fixed facility and transported to field locations in containers. Its modern successor is the Unitized Group Ration \u2013 A (UGR-A), which combines multiple types of rations, including the A-ration, under one unified system.The A-ration differs from other American alphabetized rations such as the B-ration, consisting of canned or preserved food; C-ration, consisting of prepared wet food when A- and B-rations are not available; D-ration, consisting of military chocolate; K-ration, consisting of three balanced meals; and emergency rations, intended for emergencies when other food or rations are unavailable.\n\nUnitized Group Ration A\nA-rations today may include the Unitized Group Ration \u2013 A, a hybrid meal kit designed to feed a group of 50 people for one meal. The UGR-A has several different varieties, including a tray-based heat and serve (T-rat) form, heated by hot water immersion when a field kitchen is not available, or the express form, with a self-heating module and disposable accessories. The UGR-A is used to sustain military personnel during worldwide operations that allow organized food service facilities.  \nThe UGR-A includes perishable/frozen type entrees (A-rations) along with commercial-type components and perishable/frozen type entrees to provide the luxury of an A-ration meal in the field, configured into individual meal modules for ease of ordering, distribution, and preparation. The UGR-A has at least 9 months shelf life (at 80 \u00b0F or 27 \u00b0C for semi-perishable modules and at 0 \u00b0F or \u221218 \u00b0C for perishable modules).\n\nNotes\nExternal links\nWebsite on Military Nutrition Research \u2013 This website documents more than a century of scientific inquiry conducted by, for, and about the U.S. military to promote and sustain the nutritional health of military personnel and citizens alike.\nPassage 9:\nRaw bar\nA raw bar is a small restaurant or a bar within a restaurant where live shellfish are shucked and served.

It is the only railway station in Thailand in the Bavarian style.\n\nTrain services\nSpecial Express 7/8 Bangkok-Chiang Mai-Bangkok\nSpecial Express 13/14 Bangkok-Chiang Mai-Bangkok\nExpress 51/52 Bangkok-Chiang Mai-Bangkok\nRapid 102 Chiang Mai-Bangkok\nRapid 109 Bangkok-Chiang Mai\nLocal 407/408 Nakhon Sawan-Chiang Mai-Nakhon Sawan\nPassage 4:\nAughton Park railway station\nAughton Park railway station is a railway station that serves the village of Aughton, Lancashire, England, on the Ormskirk branch of the Northern Line of the Merseyrail network 11\u00bd miles (19 km) north east of Liverpool Central. During the 2020/21 and 2021/22 periods, Aughton Park was the least used station on the Merseyrail Network.\n\nHistory\nThe station is below ground level built into a cutting. Opened by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, Aughton Park Station was originally coupled with a freight siding, Crook's Sand Siding, which serviced two nearby quarries. The station became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The line then passed on to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948.\nWhen sectorisation was introduced, the station was served by Regional Railways on behalf of the Merseyside PTE until the privatisation of British Railways.\n\nFacilities\nThe station is staffed throughout the day (like all Merseytravel stations), with the ticket office open from start of service until the last train has called throughout the week. There are shelters on both platforms and a pay phone on platform 1. Train running information is provided by automated announcements and digital display screens. No step-free access to either platform is available.\n\nServices\nTrains operate every 15 minutes on Monday to Saturday daytimes between Ormskirk and Liverpool Central, and every 30 minutes at other times (evenings and Sundays).\nPassage 5:\nBueng Phra Railway Station\nBueng Phra railway station is a railway station located in Bueng Phra Subdistrict, Phitsanulok City, Phitsanulok.

It is the terminus of the Royal National Park railway line, formerly part of the Sydney commuter rail network and now operated by the Sydney Tramway Museum. The station opened in 1886 and was served by trains on the Sydney network until 1991 when the Royal National Park railway line was closed due to low patronage. The line and station were transferred to the Sydney Tramway Museum and re-opened in May 1993 for heritage tramway operations.\nThe museum operates services on the line on Wednesdays and Sundays, with the first service running at 10:15 am. Departures are hourly from then on, with the last one at 2:30 pm on Wednesday and 4:30 pm on Sunday. It is a popular means of access to the Royal National Park.\n\nHistory\nThe station opened as Loftus on 9 March 1886 (the station currently known as Loftus was then called Loftus Junction). It was renamed National Park on 1 May 1889, back to Loftus in January 1890 and back again to National Park on 1 December 1896. It was finally renamed Royal National Park on 16 July 1955. The original island platform could accommodate ten carriages. There was also a goods bank and five sidings.  Royal National Park was included in the electrification of the Illawarra railway line in 1926 and remained the southern limit of electrification until 1980 when overhead wiring was extended to Waterfall.\nAt its peak in the 1930s, the line was served by 25 trains a day on weekends. On 4 July 1967, three of the five sidings at the station were removed. In 1978, the original station was demolished to make way for a visitor's centre and a new single platform built. By 1988, the line was being served by only three trains a day.After the Cowan rail accident in 1990, the Royal National Park branch line was used for safety tests. Because of the small number of services running on the line, it was also used for driver training.Following the discovery of signalling faults, services ceased on 11 June 1991. With major expenditure required and average patronage having dwindled to three passengers per train, the line was formally closed. The line was taken over by the Sydney Tramway Museum with Royal National Park station re-opening as the line's terminus in May 1993.  Due to the design of the heritage trams running on the line, they are unable to use the actual station platform.In October 2010 a new low level tram platform was built next to Loftus Oval for the Breakfast Torque event held every October at Loftus Oval. The Sydney tramway museum was hired by Sutherland Council to run a scheduled tram shuttle service from the Tafe car park  next to the Tafe level crossing at Pitt street, to Loftus Oval and return picking up or setting down passengers at the other side of Pitt Street for Loftus station. This was in response to the limited availability of parking at Loftus Oval.\n\nServices\nPassage 7:\nOrmskirk railway station\nOrmskirk railway station in Ormskirk, Lancashire, England, is a cross-platform interchange between Merseyrail services from Liverpool Central and Northern Trains services from Preston on the Ormskirk branch line, 12+3\u20444 miles (20.5 km) northeast of Liverpool.  The station building and three arch road bridge are both Grade II listed structures.\n\nHistory\nThe station was built by the East Lancashire Railway's Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Junction section, and opened on 2 April 1849.  From 13 May 1859, the station was owned by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. From 1 January 1923 the station was owned by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. British Railways nationalised all railways on 1 January 1948 and the station became part of the London Midland Region.\nA branch line to Rainford Junction via Skelmersdale was opened by the ELR in March 1858 shortly before it was absorbed by the L&YR \u2013 this left the main line to Preston just to the north of the station.  The line from Liverpool was subsequently electrified in 1913, with the suburban EMUs using a bay platform at the southern end of the station to keep them clear of the busy main line to Preston, which was used as the L&Y's principal route to East Lancashire, the Fylde, Cumbria and Scotland.\n\n1977\nThe original Liverpool terminus of the line (Liverpool Exchange) was closed in 1977, when the route became one of the three branches of the new Northern Line and trains began running to a new underground terminus at Liverpool Central.  Since 1996, it has been part of the Merseyrail franchise currently (2016) run by Serco-Abellio.\n\nStation layout\nThe current station consists of a single platform.  An interesting characteristic is how the electric Merseyrail track and the unelectrified Northern track is on the same alignment, with electric and diesel trains using opposite ends of the same platform. The line is cut by a large buffer separating the track sections. Passengers wishing to transfer from an electric train to diesel train walk a dozen yards or so along the same platform to move between trains.  A similar layout exists at Kirkby station.\nPrior to the Beeching Report of 1963 and the subsequent restructuring of the rail network, there were two main through platforms. The electric Liverpool commuter trains would pull into the southern bay platform.  This practice ended following the withdrawal of through trains between Liverpool and Preston via this route. Local services from Preston, East Lancashire and Blackpool towards Liverpool were either withdrawn or terminated at Ormskirk from October 1969 with the last through trains running on 3 May 1970. From 4 May 1970 the line was split, with all trains using the former Liverpool platform (the Preston-bound platform remains, however is disused). The bay platform is now a footpath leading to the bus station.\nOnly a single Merseyrail third-rail electric line runs into the platform, the route towards Liverpool becomes double immediately outside the station. The line from Ormskirk to Preston has been single track since the summer of 1970, except for a passing loop at Rufford.\nThe former link between Ormskirk and Southport, via the Burscough Curves, was closed in 1962. The Skelmersdale Branch has also been lost, having closed to passengers in 1956 and to all traffic seven years later. It was lifted in 1968, though the Burscough curves remained extant until the mid-1980s.\n\nFacilities\nThe station underwent a \u00a31.5 million renovation during 2009.  Among the refurbishments include a new booking hall, waiting room, toilet facilities, ticket counters and new automatic swinging doors, as well as a remodelled and landscaped path and bicycle route up to the bus interchange. The station is classed as eco-friendly and gets its green credentials by using a system that harvests rainwater, as well as other various energy-saving measures. During October & November 2018 the height, width and layout of the platforms were adjusted to prepare for Merseyrail's new fleet of trains which are due to be introduced from 2020.The station is staffed, 15 minutes before the first train and 15 minutes after the last train, and has platform CCTV. There is a payphone, waiting room, booking office and live departure and arrival screens, for passenger information. The station has a free car park, with 108 spaces, as well as a 2-space cycle rack and secure storage for 28 cycles. The station and platforms have full disabled access but the car park has uneven ramp access.\n\nServices\nServices to Liverpool Central operate frequently, running every 15 minutes during the day (Mon-Sat) and every 30 minutes at other times (evenings and Sundays).  Services to Preston now run hourly Monday\u2013Saturday (since the May 2018 timetable change). There is no Sunday service.\n\nFuture\nThere have been calls from local authorities and the local rail user group to reopen both curves at Burscough to allow the reinstatement of through trains from Ormskirk to Southport, as well as to reinstate through services between Preston and Liverpool via Ormskirk and to rebuild and reopen the Skelmersdale branch. Merseytravel's 2014 Liverpool City Region Long Term Rail Strategy does not back plans for an Ormskirk to Skelmersdale route (instead proposing that the link be provided from the Kirkby to Wigan Wallgate line), but it suggests that a new bi-level interchange at Burscough Bridge could be built, to provide improved interchange facilities between the Ormskirk branch and the Wigan to Southport line, in addition to reopening the curves and extending electrification through to Preston and Southport.Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, Long Term Rail Strategy document of October 2017, page 37, states a review to introduce new Merseyrail battery trains will be undertaken in 2020, in view to put Preston interchange station onto the Merseyrail network by extending the Merseyrail Northern Line from Ormskirk to Preston. The aim is to have Preston one of the terminals of the Northern Line, with Burscough Junction, Rufford and Croston stations brought onto the Merseyrail network. The document states, \"The potential use of battery powered Merseyrail units may improve the business case\".\n\nGallery\nSee also\nListed buildings in Ormskirk\nPassage 8:\nPhichai Railway Station\nPhichai railway station is a railway station located in Nai Mueang Subdistrict, Phichai District, Uttaradit.

It is regarded as the signature food of the locality. Because Pichai is a district surrounded by mountains and rivers, it is a place rich in food ingredients.\n\nTrain services\nSpecial Express 3/4 Bangkok-Sawankhalok/Sila At-Bangkok\nExpress 51/52 Bangkok-Chiang Mai-Bangkok\nRapid 102 Chiang Mai Bangkok\nRapid 105/106 Bangkok-Sila At-Bangkok\nRapid 107/108 Bangkok-Den Chai-Bangkok\nRapid 109 Bangkok-Chiang Mai\nRapid 111/112 Bangkok-Den Chai-Bangkok\nLocal 403 Phitsanulok-Sila At\nLocal 407/408 Nakhon Sawan-Chiang Mai-Nakhon Sawan\nLocal 410 Sila At-Phitsanulok\nPassage 9:\nOrrell Park railway station\nOrrell Park railway station is a railway station in Orrell Park, Liverpool, England.

In 1997, he became the first Indian to win a major tournament (with Rika Hiraki). With his win at the 2006 Australian Open mixed doubles, he joined the elite group of eight tennis players who have achieved a career Grand Slam in mixed doubles. He is also the founder of International Premier Tennis League. In December 2016, Bhupathi was appointed as India's next non-playing Davis Cup captain and took over the reins from Anand Amritraj in February 2017.\n\nCareer\n1995\u20132006\nMahesh Bhupathi is considered one of the top doubles players of the 1990s and 2000s. In 1999, Bhupathi won three doubles titles with Leander Paes, including the French Open and Wimbledon. He and Paes became the first doubles team to reach the finals of all four Grand Slams, the first time such a feat has been achieved in the open era and the first time since 1952.

Founded in 1886, it is one of the world's oldest tennis associations. It is affiliated to both International Tennis Federation and Oceania Tennis Federation. Tennis NZ has six geographically divided regional centres. Tennis NZ operates all of the New Zealand's national representative tennis sides, including the New Zealand Davis Cup team, the New Zealand Billie Jean King Cup team and youth sides as well. Tennis NZ is also responsible for organising and hosting tennis tournaments within New Zealand and scheduling the home international fixtures.\n\nHistory\nThe history of tennis in New Zealand dates back to the 1870s, the decade when the development of modern tennis began. The first New Zealand Tennis Championships were played at Farndon Park in Clive, Hawke's Bay, in December 1885. New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association (NZLTA) was formed at a meeting held in Hastings in December 1886. Shortly after its inauguration, the New Zealand Association became affiliated with the Lawn Tennis Association (England).In 1904 New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association amalgamated with six Australian state tennis associations to form the Lawn Tennis Association of Australasia. New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association played a significant role in the origin of the Australian Open. Lawn Tennis Association of Australasia created the tournament called The Australasian Mens Championships (which later became Australian Open) in 1905 and was first played in Warehouseman's Cricket Ground and it was decided that championships would be hosted by both Australian as well as New Zealand venues. New Zealand hosted the championship twice\u2014 Christchurch (1906) and Hastings (1912). The geographical remoteness of both the countries (Australia and New Zealand) made it difficult for foreign players to enter the tournament. In Christchurch in 1906, of a small field of 10 players, only two Australians attended, and the tournament was won by a New Zealander (Tony Wilding). Lawn Tennis Association of Australasia was one of the twelve national associations of tennis which established the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) in a conference in Paris, France, on 1 March 1913. From 1905 until 1919, New Zealand and Australian tennis players participated in the International Lawn Tennis Challenge (Davis Cup) under the alias of \"Team Australasia\", the team claimed a title six times (1907, 1908, 1909, 1911, 1914, 1919), however, there were attempts to severance this trans-Tasman partnership, in order to allow New Zealand players to represent their nation on international tennis events. In 1922, New Zealand dropped out from this partnership and on 16 March 1923 New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association was granted affiliation to the International Lawn Tennis Association and thereby became eligible to enter the International Lawn Tennis Challenge in its own right. New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association filed its first challenge with United States Lawn Tennis Association for 1924 International Lawn Tennis Challenge. Tennis New Zealand was the founding member of Oceania Tennis Federation in 1993.\n\nStructure\nGoverning staff\nConstitution\nThe constitution of the organisation was adopted on 12 August 2006 in the Special General Meeting in which the main purpose of the organisation is defined as to promote, develop, enhance and protect the sport of tennis mainly as an amateur sport for the recreation and entertainment of the general public in New Zealand.\n\nAffiliates\nRegional centres\nTennis NZ consists of six regional centres which are affiliated to the national body. They control their own activities subject to any requirements which may, from time to time, be legislated for by the national body.\n\nOrganisations\nTennis NZ affiliates several different tennis related private organisations, which are:\nAotearoa Maori Tennis Association (AMTA) - national tennis body of M\u0101ori people.\nNZ Tennis Umpires Association (NZTUA) -  national body, which governs tennis officiating in New Zealand.\nTennis Coaches NZ (TCNZ) -  New Zealand's association for professional tennis coaches.\nInternational Lawn Tennis Club of NZ - member of Council of International Lawn Tennis Clubs, established in 1956 and has around 130 members.\nNZ Wheelchair Tennis - Hamilton based organisation affiliated with International Wheelchair Tennis Association (IWTA) governs Wheelchair tennis in New Zealand.\nSeniors Tennis NZ - national association for tennis players aged 35 years and above.\n\nTournaments\nTennis NZ annually organises range of events from local tournaments to national and international events. Tennis Auckland hosts two major events of international tennis tournaments each year at the ASB Tennis Centre, Parnell, just prior to Australian Open:\nASB Classic - is a most prominent women's and men's tournament of New Zealand. This ATP Tour and WTA Tour event is an International series tournament and is played on outdoor hardcourts during the first week of the tennis season.\nPassage 2:\nAlbert Costa\nAlbert Costa Casals (Catalan pronunciation: [\u0259l\u02c8\u03b2\u025b\u027e(t) \u02c8k\u0254st\u0259j k\u0259\u02c8zals]; born 25 June 1975) is a Spanish former professional tennis player. He is best remembered for winning the men's singles title at the French Open in 2002.\n\nTennis career\nCosta began playing tennis at the age of five. He first came to the tennis world's attention as an outstanding junior player. In 1993, he reached the French Open junior final and won the Orange Bowl. He turned professional later that year and quickly established a reputation as a strong clay court player. Spanish former player and commentator for Spanish television Andr\u00e9s Gimeno used to call him \"the man with two forehands\", because he could hit with the same accuracy and strength both forehand and backhand. In 1994, he won two challenger series events and was named the ATP's Newcomer of the Year.\nCosta won his first top-level singles title in 1995 at Kitzb\u00fchel, beating the \"King of Clay\", Thomas Muster, in a five set final. It was Muster's first of only 2 losses on clay in 1995. Costa ended Muster's streak of 40 consecutive clay match wins and his 11 consecutive final wins . Costa won three further titles in 1996. In 1997, he won another two singles titles and was part of the Spanish team that won the World Team Cup. He won another two singles titles in 1998, including the Tennis Masters Series event in Hamburg and played at magnificent level at the French Open, only a brilliant Marcelo R\u00edos could stop him at fourth round, but he established the bases for his future winning in 2002. Three further titles followed in 1999.\nIn 2000, Costa helped Spain win its first Davis Cup. Despite being knocked out in the first round in men's singles, he also captured a bronze medal in the men's doubles at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, partnering \u00c1lex Corretja.\nGoing into the French Open in 2002, Costa had not won a tour title of any kind since 1999 and was not considered to be among the favorites. Seeded 20th, he defeated Richard Gasquet, Nikolay Davydenko and Andrea Gaudenzi to reach the fourth round, where he defeated two time defending-champion and former world No. 1 Gustavo Kuerten in straight sets. Costa followed up with a five-set victory over Argentina's Guillermo Ca\u00f1as in the quarterfinals. He then defeated fellow-Spaniard, former world No. 2 and long-time friend \u00c0lex Corretja in a four-set semifinal. In the final, Costa came up against another Spaniard, future world No. 1, Juan Carlos Ferrero. Ferrero had been in fine form in the run-up to the event and most observers considered him to be the heavy favourite going into the final. But Costa won in four sets, 6\u20131, 6\u20130, 4\u20136, 6\u20133, to claim his first Grand Slam title. Costa destroyed Ferrero, who could only win nine points during Costa's service games in the first 2 sets. The win propelled him to his career-high singles ranking of World No. 6 in July 2002.\nComing into the French Open as defending-champion in 2003, Costa spent a total of 21 hours and 15 minutes on court, winning four five-setters before eventually being knocked-out in a semifinal by Ferrero (who went on to win the title).\nDuring his career, Costa won 12 top-level singles titles. In 2005, he captured his first tour doubles title (in Doha, partnering Rafael Nadal).\nCiting recurring injuries and lack of desire, he officially announced his retirement from competitive professional tennis on 21 April 2006, at the completion of the Open Seat 2006 in his hometown in Barcelona. In his last tournament, Costa defeated American Vincent Spadea and Slovakian Dominik Hrbat\u00fd before losing 6\u20131, 5\u20137, 7\u20135 to Ferrero in the third round.\nIn December 2008, Costa was named Spain's Davis Cup captain, replacing Emilio S\u00e1nchez Vicario. Costa became the most successful Spanish Davis Cup captain to date as he led Spain to two Davis Cup titles in 2009 and 2011, before handing the captaincy over to \u00c0lex Corretja.\nCosta was coaching ATP pro Feliciano L\u00f3pez.\n\nPersonal life\nHe grew up with John McEnroe as his idol. Besides tennis, he enjoys playing cards, table tennis, golf, and soccer. He is also a fan of Barcelona and his hometown team UE Lleida. He also admires Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, and Ronaldo.\nLess than a week after his triumph at the 2002 French Open, Costa married his long-time girlfriend Cristina Ventura. \u00c0lex Corretja was the best man at the wedding. The couple have twin daughters, Claudia and Alma, who were born on 21 April 2001.\n\nCareer statistics\nGrand Slam tournament performance timeline\nFinals: 1 (1 title)\nYear-End Championship performance timeline\nSee also\nList of Grand Slam men's singles champions\n\nSources\nExternal links\nAlbert Costa at the Association of Tennis Professionals \nAlbert Costa at the International Tennis Federation \nAlbert Costa at the Davis Cup \nAlbert Costa at ESPN.com \nAlbert Costa at Olympedia \nAlbert Costa at Olympics.com\nPassage 3:\n1995 Austrian Open\nThe 1995 EA Generali Open, also known as Austrian Open, was a men's tennis tournament held at the Kitzb\u00fcheler Tennisclub in Kitzb\u00fchel, Austria and played on outdoor clay courts.

Nadal won a career-best 11 singles titles, including then-season-record 4 Masters 1000 titles and his maiden Grand Slam title at the French Open on his first attempt, making him the first teenager since Pete Sampras (1990 US Open) to win a major. He finished the year with 79 calendar match wins, the most by any teenager in ATP Tour history, and the world No. 2 ranking. He was awarded the ATP Most Improved Player of the Year award.\n\nAustralian Open\nAt the 2005 Australian Open, Nadal lost in the fourth round to eventual runner-up Lleyton Hewitt.\n\nHard court\nNadal reached the final of the 2005 Miami Masters, and despite being two points from a straight-sets victory, he was defeated in five sets by Roger Federer.\n\nClay court\nNadal dominated the 2005 clay court season. He won 24 consecutive singles matches, which broke Andre Agassi's Open Era record of consecutive match wins for a male teenager. Nadal won the Torneo Conde de God\u00f3 in Barcelona and beat 2004 French Open runner-up Guillermo Coria in the finals of the 2005 Monte Carlo Masters and the 2005 Rome Masters. During the Rome quarterfinals against Radek \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nek, Nadal hit what is considered by many as the greatest shot of his career, a no-look, running passing shot near the net. These victories raised his ranking to world No. 5 and made him one of the favorites at his career-first French Open. On his 19th birthday, Nadal defeated Federer in the 2005 French Open semifinals, as one of only four players who defeated the world No. 1 that year (along with Marat Safin, Richard Gasquet, and David Nalbandian). Two days later, he defeated Mariano Puerta in the final, becoming the second male player after Mats Wilander to win the French Open on his first attempt. He also became the first male teenager to win a Grand Slam singles title since Pete Sampras won the 1990 US Open at age 19. Winning the French Open improved Nadal's ranking to world No. 3.\n\nGrass court\nThree days after his victory in Paris, Nadal's 24-match winning streak was snapped in the first round of the grass court Gerry Weber Open in Halle, Germany, where he lost to the German Alexander Waske. He then lost in the second round of 2005 Wimbledon to Gilles M\u00fcller of Luxembourg.\n\nSummer hard court\nImmediately after Wimbledon, Nadal won 16 consecutive matches and three consecutive tournaments, bringing his ranking to world No. 2 on 25 July 2005. Nadal started his North American summer hard-court season by defeating Agassi in the final of the 2005 Canada Masters, but lost in the first round of the 2005 Cincinnati Masters. Nadal was seeded second at the 2005 US Open, where he was upset in the third round by world No. 49 James Blake in four sets.\nIn September, he defeated Coria in the final of the China Open in Beijing and won both of his Davis Cup matches against Italy. In October, he won his fourth ATP Masters Series title of the year, defeating Ivan Ljubi\u010di\u0107 in the final of the 2005 Madrid Masters. He then suffered a foot injury that prevented him from competing in the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup.Both Nadal and Federer won eleven singles titles and four ATP Masters Series titles in 2005. Nadal broke Mats Wilander's previous teenage record of nine in 1983. Eight of Nadal's titles were on clay, and the remainder were on hard courts. Nadal won 79 matches, second only to Federer's 81.\n\nSingles Matches\nSee also\n2005 ATP Tour\n2005 Roger Federer tennis season\nPassage 9:\nSteve Denton\nSteve Denton (born September 5, 1956) is a former professional tennis player for the ATP Tour.

In 1984, Denton set a service record of 138 mph (222 km/h) that would stand for 13 years until it was broken in 1997 by Mark Philippoussis who recorded a 142 mph (229 km/h) delivery.  The current record of 163 mph (262 km/h) is held by Sam Groth.\nHe reached six singles finals, most notably the Australian Open (in 1981 and 1982) and the Cincinnati Masters (in 1982). He also won 18 doubles titles (including the US Open and the Canada Masters) in 1982, and reaching 23 additional doubles finals.\n\nGrand Slam finals\nSingles (2 losses)\nDoubles (1 win, 1 loss)\nMixed Doubles (3 losses)\nGrand Slam tournament performance timeline\nSingles\nCareer finals\nDoubles (18 wins, 21 losses)\nSingles: 6 (6 losses)\nCoaching career\nDenton made his first head coaching debut at Texas A&M\u2013Corpus Christi in 2001.

The natural range of distribution is from Eden (37\u00b0 S) in south eastern New South Wales to Bowen (20\u00b0 S) in tropical Queensland.\n\nDescription\nA shrub or small tree growing to 9 metres in height and a trunk diameter of 30 cm. The trunk is cylindrical or somewhat flanged at the butt in larger plants. Bark is fawnish brown or grey, fairly smooth with some lines of vertical bumps and other irregularities. Branchlets often hairy, green turning to fawn with lenticels.\nLeaves alternate, simple and toothed in an irregular manner. Oblong or elliptical in shape, 5 to 12 cm long with a blunt leaf tip. Leaf stalks 1 to 4 cm long. Usually with two small glands at the apex. The midrib is paler than the leaf itself, venation is more evident under the leaf.\nGreenish flowers form on racemes in the months of October to November. Male and female flowers on separate plants, being dioecious. The fruit matures in January to March, being a purple/black capsule. Globular in shape, 6 mm in diameter. Within each of the three lobes of the capsule is one red warty seed. Its fruit is eaten by the brown cuckoo-dove and Australian king parrot.\nPassage 6:\nRhodotypos\nRhodotypos scandens, the sole species of the genus Rhodotypos, is a deciduous shrub in the family Rosaceae, closely related to Kerria and included in that genus by some botanists. It is native to China, Korea, possibly also Japan.\n\nDescription\nIt grows to 2\u20135 m tall, with (unusually for a species in the Rosaceae) opposite (not alternate) leaves, simple ovate-acute, 3\u20136 cm long and 2\u20134 cm broad with a serrated margin. The flowers are white, 3\u20134 cm diameter, and (also unusually) have four (not five) petals; flowering is from late spring to mid-summer. The fruit is a cluster of 1-4 shiny black drupes 5\u20138 mm diameter.\nIt does not have a widely used English name, most commonly being known by its genus name rhodotypos, also occasionally as jetbead or jet-bead. It is an invasive species in some parts of eastern North America.\n\nReferences and external links\n\nFlora of China\nPassage 7:\nAlyxia oliviformis\nAlyxia stellata, known as maile in Hawaiian, is a species of flowering plant in the dogbane family, Apocynaceae, that is native to Hawaii. It grows as either a twining liana, scandent shrub, or small erect shrub, and is one of the few vines that are endemic to the islands. The binomial nomenclature means \"chain resembling olive\" in Latin. The leaves are usually ternate, sometimes opposite, and can show both types on the same stem. Flowers are quite inconspicuous and have a sweet and light fragrance of honey. The bark is most fragrant and exudes a slightly sticky, milky sap when punctured, characteristic of the family Apocynaceae.  The entire plant contains coumarin, a sweet-smelling compound that is also present in vanilla grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), woodruff (Galium odoratum) and mullein (Verbascum spp.).  Fruit are oval and dark purple when ripe.  Maile is a morphologically variable plant and the Hawaiian names reflect this (see Ethnobotany section).\n\nDistribution and habitat\nMaile can occur in most types of vegetation at elevations from 50 to 2,000 metres (200 to 6,600 ft) on all of the main Hawaiian Islands, however it is believed that both Kaho\u02bbolawe and Ni\u02bbihau likely had populations of the species before large-scale disturbances occurred. Lowland wet forests occur from 100\u20131,200 m (300\u20133,900 ft) elevation in the Hawaiian Islands and are prime habitat for maile, receiving 150\u2013500 cm (60\u2013200 in) of rainfall annually. Maile is also found in montane mesic and wet communities.\n\nEthnobotanical uses\nLei\nMaile is traditionally and still most popularly used in lei.  The vines are prepared and twined together to make an open lei or if people prefer they can close it.  In more rural areas it is typical for someone to pick their own maile if accessible, however because lei maile is so desirable, many floral shops carry these kinds of lei.  It is one of the only endemic Hawaiian plants grown commercially for lei.  Commercial maile plantations have become more common as some people feel that imported (non-Hawaiian) maile  is not as fragrant as Hawaiian maile.\n\nL\u0101\u02bbau Lapa\u02bbau\nThis plant was used medicinally to treat puho, puka puhi, kaupo, and  na \u02bbeha moku kukonukonu e a\u02bbe (other cuts).  Maile kaluhea was mashed with \u02bbauko\u02bbi (Senna occidentalis) stalks, \u02bbahakea (Bobea spp.) and koa (Acacia koa) bark.  After water is added to this mixture and heated, it is put on infected areas to clean.\n\nLocal tradition\nLei maile are often worn by the groom, and also by the groom's men in weddings which is a lovely sight.  For high school proms in Hawai\u02bbi, the boy is often given a lei maile.  Birthdays, graduations, anniversaries and any celebration for that matter are all an occasion for lei maile, however many responsible stewards to the land understand there is not enough maile to go around for everyone.  This ties back in to local maile plantations that have started up.\n\nKapa\nKapa, pounded wauke (Broussonetia papyrifera) is traditionally scented using fragrant plants such as maile, mokihana (Melicope anisata), laua\u02bbe (Phymatosorus scolopendria), \u02bbiliahi (Santalum spp.) and kamani (Calophyllum inophyllum).\n\nConservation\nBecause maile is desirable for harvesting it is often incorporated into restoration plantings which can help bring the community into the conservation process.  One study looked at the potential of planting native Hawaiian plants as an understory layer to reduce weedy seedlings from sprouting up and gaining hold again in a restored area.  Maile, m\u0101maki (Pipturus albidus) and palapalai (Microlepia strigosa) were the plants used.\n\nFolklore\nMention of the maile plant occurs in various stories (mo\u02bbolelo),  proverbs (\u02bb\u014dlelo no\u02bbeau), and in the song (mele) \"Lei \u02bbAwapuhi\".\n\nL\u0101\u02bbieikawai\nThe maile sisters are a favorite stock characters in Hawaiian romance tales. The story of L\u0101\u02bbieikawai  tells of five Maile sisters. Maile ha\u02bbi wale (brittle maile), Maile lau li\u02bbi (small-leaved maile), Maile lau nui (large-leaved maile), Maile kaluhea (sweet-scented maile), and Maile pakaha (blunt-leaved maile).\nKauai's maile lau li\u02bbi is often celebrated in song and chant.  The \u02bb\u014dlelo no\u02bbeau, Ka maile lau li\u02bbi o Ko\u02bbiahi speaks of the \"fine-leaved\" maile of Koke\u02bbe, Kaua\u02bbi which had one of the best and most fragrant maile lau li\u02bbi in Hawai\u02bbi and was praised in old chants. Because maile was often placed on heiau in traditional times, the older generations of Hawaiians say that the fragrance of maile still lingers in those areas where heiau once stood or are still standing.\n\nPuna and Pana\u02bbewa\nSeveral \u02bb\u014dlelo no\u02bbeau from the Hilo and Puna districts on Hawai\u02bbi Island paint a wonderfully fragrant picture of Puna and Pana\u02bbewa.  Ka makani hali \u02bbala o Puna, the fragrance-bearing wind of Puna; Lei Hanakahi i ke \u02bbala me ke onaona o Pana\u02bbewa, Hanakahi is adorned with the fragrance and perfume of Pana\u02bbewa. These were both places that had a moist climate suitable for maile and other fragrant ferns, as well as the famous hala (Pandanus tectorius) from Puna.  The phrase Puna paia \u02bbala, fragrant walls of Puna, gives reference to the h\u012bnano blossom which was famously hung inside hale of that district to scent the house.  People traveled to both Puna and Pana\u02bbewa in order to pick maile, hence those areas being remembered as fragrant.\n\nM\u014dl\u012b\nMary Kawena Pukui tells a story from Ka\u02bb\u016b on Hawai\u02bbi Island of a beautiful young woman, M\u014dl\u012b, whose father will let none other than a fisherman marry her (a good fisherman is well liked and prosperous because of the food he catches; it is also a sign of a much desired hard-working man).  A certain worthless fisherman who tricked M\u014dl\u012b's father by rubbing fish guts (which were thrown out by others) on himself took her hand in marriage and did no work afterwards.  Driven to desperation, M\u014dl\u012b decorated herself with a beautiful lei of ginger (Zingiber zerumbet), fern and maile and threw herself over the cliffs at Wai\u02bbahukini.  It is said each year around the time of her death, M\u014dl\u012b returns and when the wind blows, moaning and wailing can be heard.  The maile fragrance of her lei can also be smelled and if anyone goes there wearing a maile lei, they will be knocked to the ground.\n\nKeaoua Kekuaokalani\nKeaoua Kekuaokalani, a cousin to Liholiho (Kamehameha II), objected to the overturn of the kapu system and with supporters, they gathered together with weapons at the battle of Kuamo\u02bbo in attempt to restore the kapu taken away.  Hawaiians from the area where the battle took place hold that the fragrance of maile worn by the Kekuaokalani's warriors into battle can still be smelled.\nPassage 8:\nLycium cooperi\nLycium cooperi is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family known by the common name peach thorn. It is native to the southwestern United States,  where it grows in a variety of desert and mountain habitat types. This is a bushy, erect shrub approaching a maximum height of 4 metres (13 ft) with many rigid, thorny branches. The branches are lined thickly with fleshy oval or widely lance-shaped leaves each 1\u20133 centimetres (0.39\u20131.18 in) long and coated with glandular hairs. The inflorescence is a small cluster of tubular flowers roughly 1\u20132 centimetres (0.39\u20130.79 in) long including the calyx of fleshy sepals at the base. The flower is white or greenish with lavender or green veining. The corolla is a tube opening into a face with four or five lobes. The fruit is a yellow or orange berry under a centimeter wide containing many seeds.\nPassage 9:\nCeanothus velutinus\nCeanothus velutinus, with the common names snowbrush ceanothus, red root, and tobacco brush, is a species of shrub in the family Rhamnaceae. It is native to western North America from British Columbia to California to Colorado, where it grows in several habitat types including coniferous forest, chaparral, and various types of woodland.\n\nDescription\nCeanothus velutinus grows up to 4 meters tall but generally remains under three, and forms colonies of individuals which tangle together to form nearly impenetrable thickets. The aromatic evergreen leaves are alternately arranged, each up to 8 centimeters long. The leaves are oval in shape with minute glandular teeth along the edges, and shiny green and hairless on the top surface.\nThe plentiful inflorescences are long clusters of white flowers. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule a few millimeters long which snaps open explosively to expel the three seeds onto the soil, where they may remain in a buried seed bank for well over 200 years before sprouting. The seed is coated in a very hard outer layer that must be scarified, generally by wildfire, before it can germinate. Like most other ceanothus, this species fixes nitrogen via actinomycetes in its root nodules.\n\nUses\nDeer and elk browse the plant during winter.Some Plateau Indian tribes drank a boil of this plant to induce sweating as a treatment for colds, fevers, and influenza. Leaves were also used when rinsing to help prevent dandruff.Ceanothus velutinus was known as \"red root\" by many Native American tribes due to the color of the inner root bark, and was used as a medicine for treating lymphatic disorders, ovarian cysts, fibroid tumors, and tonsillitis.  Clinical studies of the alkaloid compounds in C. velutinus has verified its effectiveness in treating high blood pressure and lymphatic blockages.\nPassage 10:\nCeanothus sanguineus\nCeanothus sanguineus is a species of shrub in the family Rhamnaceae known by the common name redstem ceanothus. It is native to western North America from British Columbia to Montana to far northern California; it is also known from Michigan. It grows in temperate coniferous forest habitat in forest openings amidst the conifers. This is an erect shrub approaching 3 meters in maximum height. Its stem is red to purple in color, its woody parts green and hairless when new. The deciduous leaves are alternately arranged and up to about 10 centimeters long. They are thin, light green, oval, and generally edged with glandular teeth. The undersides are sometimes hairy. The inflorescence is a cluster of white flowers up to about 12 centimeters long. The fruit is a three-lobed smooth capsule about 4 millimeters long. This shrub is an important food plant for wild ungulates such as the Rocky Mountain Elk, it is browsed eagerly by many types of livestock, and the seed is consumed by many types of animals.Their roots have nitrogen fixing nodules.", "answers": ["no"], "incorrect_answer": "Yes"}, {"input": " Om and SIx Organs of Admittance are both what?", "context": "Passage 1:\nConference of the Birds (Om album)\nConference of the Birds is an album by American rock band Om. It was released on April 17, 2006, on CD and on May 15, 2006, on vinyl, both through Holy Mountain. The album was pressed on black (2000 pressings), clear orange (500), and clear green vinyl (500).

The last two were inaugurated on 4 October 1807, and a substantial number of compositions involving all six organs were produced that year.\nShortly after their completion, the French invasion and the following exile of the Portuguese Court to Brazil led to the organs decaying for lack of maintenance. A decade later \u2013 possibly in connection with the prospect of the return of the Portuguese royal family \u2013 the six organs were subject to a major intervention. The intent of these works, undertaken by Machado e Cerveira, was not only to repair the instruments but also to enlarge them. Unfortunately, the works were interrupted a few years later (Machado e Cerveira died in 1828), and several items, such as the reassembling of the organ of S\u00e3o Pedro d\u2019Alc\u00e2ntara, were left unfinished.Until 1998, the organs only received minor repairs. That year, the global restoration of the ensemble, entrusted to the Portuguese organ builder Dinarte Machado, began and was concluded in 2010. This project included the reconstruction of the organ of S\u00e3o Pedro d\u2019Alc\u00e2ntara, incorporating all the materials recovered since it was disassembled around 1820.The six organs (two in the main chapel, two in the northern transept, and two in the southern transept), although different, have several common features. Some, like the horizontal reeds and the divided keyboard, are common among Iberian instruments of the time. Other features, like the short-resonator reeds, the Italian voce umana, and especially the double-wind chest, (allowing the quick cancellation of the plenum stops) are typical of the school of Cerveira and Fontanes.Currently, the pipe organs are played in concerts organized by the Palace of Mafra and the Municipality of Mafra. They are also played in the religious ceremonies held in the basilica, namely the processions of the season of Lent in Mafra.\nPassage 3:\nRandall Dunn\nRandall Dunn is an American record producer, audio engineer, composer, and musician.\nAs a music producer, he has worked with artists and filmmakers including Danny Elfman, Jim Jarmusch, Panos Cosmatos, Nathan Fielder, Benny Safdie, Guillermo Del Toro, Bj\u00f6rk, Oneohtrix Point Never, Thurston Moore, Zola Jesus, Algiers, Sunn O))), SQ\u00dcRL, Six Organs of Admittance, Marissa Nadler, Boris, Anna Von Hausswolff, Pallbearer, Oren Ambarchi, Eyvind Kang, The Cave Singers, Akron/Family, Earth, Wolves in the Throne Room, and Jesse Sykes, among others. Pitchfork has described him as \"a go-to producer for metal but also for indie acts looking to add more edge and atmosphere.\"\n\nEarly life\nOriginally from Michigan, Dunn moved to Seattle in 1993 to explore his interest in film music. He attended the Art Institute of Seattle to study sound design for film, and formed connections with local musicians, including Skerik and Matt Chamberlain. In an interview, Dunn stated, \"I'm sort of a frustrated filmmaker that turned into a record producer. The people I met when I moved here spun me in a way that sent me down this path of treating sound the way I would have treated film.\"During his studies he received practical experience at Hanzsek Studios under the instruction of Jack Endino. He gradually became involved in the recording and producing of sessions.\n\nCareer\nRecord producer\nAs a fan of the band Naked City, Dunn contacted keyboardist Wayne Horvitz in Seattle who introduced him to Eyvind Kang. Dunn received his first credit for a session with Eyvind Kang, resulting in the piece \"5th NADE/Invisible Man\" on the 7 NADEs album released in 1996. His involvement resulted in a long-term friendship with Kang, through whom he met a number of musicians, mostly in the jazz-rock genre. Dunn was later introduced to the engineer Mell Dettmer and together they founded Aleph Studios.In 1998 he engineered the live portion of the album Bumpa by Critters Buggin, while he received a writing credit for his involvement with Mr. Birdy's Fryday by the Rockin' Teenage Combo. In 2001 he worked together with trumpet player Lesli Dalaba and guitarist Bill Horist, releasing the ambient album Zahir. He engineered Kang's 2002 album Live Low to the Earth, in the Iron Age.In 2005, he was credited as an engineer on the Impaled album Death After Life released through Century Media. In the same year, Dunn met Dylan Carlson of the band Earth in Seattle and recorded their fourth album, Hex; or Printing in the Infernal Method at Aleph Studios.After hearing his work with Asva, Stephen O'Malley contacted Dunn to produce the collaborative album between Sunn O))) and Boris, Altar. This began a long relationship with the band doing live sound and producing several of their albums including Monoliths & Dimensions and Kannon.In 2010, Dunn and Omar Souleyman entered the legendary ADA studio in Istanbul to record and produce a remix of Bj\u00f6rk's \"Crystalline\u201d which was released on her third remix album, Bastards, in 2012. In the same session, Dunn recorded a full-length Omar Souleyman album, which was not released.\nDunn began an ongoing collaboration with Native American glass artist Preston Singletary, whose work has been exhibited at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Singletary and Bernie Worrell (of Talking Heads and Funkadelic) began recording as Khu.\u00e9ex\u2019 under Dunn's musical direction in 2013.In 2017, Dunn entered the studio with Myrkur, producing her second album Mareridt.In 2018, Dunn produced Anna Von Hausswolff's fourth studio album, Dead Magic. The album was critically well received with  reviews highlighting Dunn's attention to capturing her vocal performance. Later that year, Dunn produced Cloud Nothings' fifth studio album, Last Building Burning.\nThe Association of Danish Music Critics nominated Randall Dunn for Producer of the Year in 2018 for his work with Sort Sol, Myrkur, and Childrenn.Following the release of Panos Cosmatos' Mandy, Dunn and Cosmatos conceived a fictional record made by the character Jeremiah Sand. Along with Milky Burgess, Dunn produced and co-wrote Jeremiah Sand's Lift It Down, which was issued by Sacred Bones in 2018. Pitchfork described the record as \u201c[...] a forged artifact, an album recorded largely because those who created it had so much fun inhabiting its outlandish world.\u201d The record featured Angel Deradoorian, Tad Doyle, Faith Coloccia (Mamiffer), Monika Knot (Zen Mother), and Marissa Nadler.On November 9, 2018, Dunn released his first solo studio album titled Beloved. It featured guest vocals from Frank Fisher of Algiers and Zola Jesus.Dunn produced American doom metal band Pallbearer's fourth album in 2020, Forgotten Days, which was released by Nuclear Blast and described by Consequence of Sound as \"Perhaps the best doom metal album of 2020\".In 2020, Dunn opened the studio Circular Ruin, along with Ben Greenberg and Arjan Miranda. Circular Ruin took its name after the eponymous Jorge Luis Borges story in which a surreal plot is revealed to have been dreamed. Dunn likens the act of music making to mystical themes within the Borges text; the group founded the studio as an invocation of a collective, metaphysical, and medicinal approach to music. Signifying this influence, the studio's logo is derived from the Jungian maze.Dunn and Ben Greenberg co-produced Algiers\u2019 third studio album There Is No Year, issued by Matador Records in 2020. AllMusic described the record as \u201c[...] extend[ing] the reach of their previous outings while offering a more strategically articulated, disciplined musicality without sacrificing their core sound or blunting their emotional impact.\u201dDunn produced Zola Jesus\u2019 sixth studio album Arkhon, issued by Sacred Bones in 2022. The record featured drums by Matt Chamberlain, and was hailed by Pitchfork as \u201c[...]a pleasantly shapeless record [... that] widens the scope of her music while retaining its primal, gothic spirit.\u201dDunn produced Silver Haze, the first full-length record from SQ\u00dcRL (Jim Jarmusch and Carter Logan), featuring performances from Charlotte Gainsbourg, Anika, and Mark Ribot. It will be released on May 5, 2023 by Sacred Bones.Danny Elfman's 2020 single \"Happy,\" his first solo pop single in nearly forty years, featured mixing by Dunn, as well as additional synth design.\n\nMaster Musicians of Bukkake\nIn addition to his work as a producer and engineer, Dunn is a keyboardist and founding member of the experimental group, Master Musicians of Bukkake. Dunn described the project as \"a way to escape how I make music in the studio when I'm doing records for people\".In 2004, alongside his bandmates, Dunn wrote, arranged and produced the first Master Musicians of Bukkake record, The Visible Sign of the Invisible Order. The album was released on Sun City Girls' label, Abduction Records and featured the musicians Eryn Young (vocals), James Davis, Don McGreevy, Alan Bishop, Charlie Gocher, and John Schuller.\n\nFilm and television\nIn the 2010s, Dunn's work as a record producer evolved into projects in film, including production and engineering, as well as composing and performance.\nDunn recorded several songs with Sun City Girls for the soundtrack to the 2007 Harmony Korine film Mister Lonely.In 2014, Dunn worked with Oren Ambarchi and Stephen O\u2019Malley on scoring the short film Kairos by the Belgian filmmaker Alexis Destoop. It was released as Shade Themes from Kairos on Drag City in 2014.Dunn co-produced and composed additional music for the score to the Panos Cosmatos film Mandy, along with the late J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson in 2018. The score won multiple awards for \"Best Original Score\" at the 2019 Austin Film Critics Association Awards, the 2019 Fangoria Chain Saw Awards, and the 2018 Seattle Film Critics Society Awards; it also received multiple nominations for \"Best Original Score\" at the 2018 Chicago Film Critics Association Awards and the 2018 Hollywood Music in Media Awards.In 2021, Dunn produced Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe\u2019s score to the Nia DaCosta film Candyman, with a screenplay by Jordan Peele. The score made the shortlist for the 2022 Academy Awards in the category of Best Original Score.In 2022, along with \u00dalfur Hansson, Dunn was the principal composer of the score for the television show Salvage Marines. In the same year, Dunn and Hansson composed the score for The Way of the Psychonaut, a documentary about the life and work of Stanislav Grof, founder of transpersonal psychology.Dunn was the musical director and producer of Daniel Lopatin\u2019s score to The Viewing, the 2022 Panos Cosmatos episode of Guillermo Del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities. Under Lopatin's executive production at Circular Ruin Studio, Dunn contributed additional synthesizer arrangements.In 2022, Dunn produced Robert Ouyang Rusli's score for Julio Torres\u2019 debut film Problemista, produced by Emma Stone, starring Tilda Swinton, and released by A24 in 2023.With Daniel Lopatin as the executive producer, Dunn produced the score for the Showtime series The Curse, co-created by Nathan Fielder and Benny Safdie. The score was composed by jazz keyboardist John Medeski.Dunn produced the Khu.\u00e9ex\u2019 score for the documentary on the life and work of Preston Singletary.\n\nStyle\nWhen being offered to produce someone, Dunn prefers \"people to send the roughest demos possible rather than more elaborate ones. And I try to see if it's music that I \u2013 or my aesthetics \u2013 can work with. Like, with their vision, and the end goal\". He also pointed out that \"people themselves are a really big thing for me. I just try to find people that you can spend ten days with in a small room, still enjoy each other's music and company, and be collaborative\". As a musician, Dunn described himself \"as an arranger in the studio. (...) You have to think several steps ahead as a musician \u2013 tuning, performance, rhythm \u2013 you have to think about all these layers of how sounds work\".On several occasions, Dunn has expressed a preference for the use of analog recording equipment: \"I'm not a huge fan of the predictability of digitally processed music. But when you combine it with analog, you can get a cool medium. I rarely mix in the box [i.e., entirely digitally], or use Pro Tools [a common computerized editing software] to do mixes. Everything is hands-on with faders. I'll start with tape\u2014if it's a rock band, recording to 16-track two-inch tape. It's a beautiful sound you don't hear much of any more. I like the hybrid approach with the soul of tape and the precision of digital.\"Dunn credits his open approach in the studio as being influenced by his studies of Buddhism and psychology.\n\nDiscography\nSolo studio albums\n\nBeloved (Figureight, 2018)Collaborative albums\n\nLesli Dalaba/Bill Horist/Randall Dunn, Zahir (Endless Records, 2001)\nOren Ambarchi/Stephen O'Malley/Randall Dunn, Shade Themes From Kairos (Drag City, 2014)As Master Musicians of Bukkake\n\nThe Visible Sign of the Invisible Order (Abduction, 2004)\nTotem One (Conspiracy Records, 2009)\nTotem Two (Important Records, 2010)\nTotem Three (Important Records, 2011)\nFar West (Important Records, 2013)\nFar West Quad Cult (Important Records, 2015)\n\nProduction credits\nPassage 4:\nThe Manifestation\nThe Manifestation is the seventh album release from experimental indie rock band, Six Organs of Admittance, released in 2004. It contains the lengthy single release of \"Manifestation\" from 2000, and a new six-part suite, The Six Stations, composed by Ben Chasny as he improvised around the noise produced by playing on a turntable the etching of the sun that appears on the back of the original single.\n\nTrack listing\n\"The Manifestation\"\n\"The Six Stations\"\nPassage 5:\nSix Organs of Admittance\nSix Organs of Admittance is the primary musical project of American guitarist Ben Chasny. Chasny's music is largely guitar-based and is often considered new folk; however, it includes obvious influences, marked by the use of drones, chimes, and eclectic percussive elements. He records albums for Drag City and Holy Mountain, among other labels.\nChasny is also a member of the psychedelic band Comets on Fire, and has working relationships with Badgerlore, Current 93, and Magik Markers. His newest project is Rangda with Richard Bishop of Sun City Girls and Six Organs contributor Chris Corsano. Six Organs of Admittance has also released a song exclusively on the 2004 new folk compilation record The Golden Apples of the Sun. The album's compiler Devendra Banhart has stated this song comes from a fully produced but unreleased Chasny album he refers to as the \"solo record,\" a bootleg of which circulates the internet.\n\nDiscography\nPassage 6:\nOm (band)\nOm (sometimes stylized as OM) is an American stoner rock band from San Francisco, California. Formed as a duo in 2003 by the rhythm section of the band Sleep (bassist Al Cisneros and drummer Chris Hakius), Om is currently a trio consisting of Cisneros, Emil Amos (drums), and Tyler Trotter (guitar).\n\nHistory\nOm's works incorporate musical structures similar to Tibetan, Byzantine and Ethiopian chanting, as heard on the debut album Variations on a Theme. The band's name itself derives from the Hindu concept of Om, which refers to the natural vibration of the universe. Every album from  Pilgrimage onward features Eastern Orthodox iconography in the cover art.\nOm's first three albums feature Al Cisneros on vocals and bass and Chris Hakius on drums.\nOn December 5, 2007, Om performed in Jerusalem. Their performance lasted for over five hours and a portion of that show was released on 12\" vinyl by Southern Lord as Live at Jerusalem.The band's 2007 album Pilgrimage was chosen as Mojo Magazine's \"Underground Album of the Year\".

The title is taken from the song \"Pennies from Heaven\" written by Johnny Burke and Arthur Johnston. It was one of several Potter serials (another being The Singing Detective) to mix the reality of the drama with a dark fantasy content, and the earliest of his works where the characters burst into extended performances of popular songs.\n\nOverview\nHoskins became an established actor in the United Kingdom following his role in this serial. The serial was directed by Piers Haggard and produced by Potter collaborator Kenith Trodd. The series also featured Nigel Havers as Conrad Baker (the suave salesman), Jenny Logan as Irene (Joan's friend), Freddie Jones as Mr. Warner (Eileen's headmaster), Michael Bilton as Eileen's dad, Will Stamp as the Barman, Tudor Davies as the cafe customer (Davies was also choreographer for the series), and Peter Bowles as the Prosecuting Counsel.\nPennies was the last of Potter's television dramas to be filmed in the 'hybrid' format of studio videotape and location 16 mm film. The production involved six weeks of filming on location, most of it in Oxfordshire, with selected shooting in the Forest of Dean (in Potter's home county of Gloucestershire, between the River Severn and the River Wye). The school where Eileen teaches is the Forest school Potter attended in Berry Hill and the children who populate the school scenes were local children cast as extras. In temporary remission from his chronic condition of psoriatic arthropathy, a rare skin and joints disease that first afflicted him at the age of 24, Potter and his wife Margaret were able to visit the location shoot in Dean.\nPennies... was transmitted in six episodes of approximately 75 minutes each from 7 March to 11 April 1978, on BBC1 and first repeated later that year. In spring of the following year, Pennies won the British Academy Television Award for Most Original Programme (Hoskins & Campbell were also nominated for BAFTA acting awards). In a 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the British Film Institute to find the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century, Pennies from Heaven was placed at number 21.\n\nLegacy\nThe original television version was released on DVD by BBC Worldwide in 2004. The first and sixth episodes have an audio commentary from Haggard and Trodd.\nPotter's memorial service in November 1994 at St James's Church in Piccadilly began with those in attendance singing \"Roll Along Prairie Moon\" to the accompaniment of a jazz quintet. Cheryl Campbell and Freddie Jones read their scene in the schoolroom from Pennies: \"As Jones stifled his tears, Campbell said: 'Nobody ever ever stops yearning' . . . In a comic interlude Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, Alan Yentob, controller of BBC1, and Kenith Trodd, Potter's producer, read a scene from Pennies. [And Trodd] told of their last meeting before the playwright's death from cancer: 'Dennis slugging Courvoisier, fortified by liquid heroin and morphine . . . after an hour he seemed to crumple and he said, 'I do have one very real fear of death. It is that you might get asked to speak at my memorial service'.\"\n\nEpisodes\nFilm adaptation\nIn 1981, the series was adapted as a film, starring Steve Martin. Potter adapted his own screenplay, and Herbert Ross directed. Potter was nominated for the 1981 Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay \u2013 according to The Times, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had him rewrite the script thirteen times. The movie was not successful at the box office, despite featuring Bernadette Peters (as Eileen), Christopher Walken (as Tom) and Vernel Bagneris (as 'the accordion man').\nMGM required Potter to buy back his copyright from the BBC (according to the same 1990 Times article, Potter paid the BBC \"something over $100,000\" for the script), and prohibited broadcast of the BBC production of Pennies for approximately ten years. In 1989, Trodd was able to buy back the rights from MGM. The BBC promptly rebroadcast Pennies in February 1990.\n\nSee also\nAl Bowlly, song composer used extensively throughout the series.\nPassage 8:\nDeep Dhillon\nDeep Dhillon is an Indian actor who works in Hindi and Punjabi cinema.

The 1986 Atlantic 10 Player of the Year, he was a three-time selection to both the All-Conference team and the All-Big 5 squad. He is one of five Saint Joseph's Hawks to be chosen in the first round of the NBA Draft (drafted by the Denver Nuggets, taken 16th overall) 1986 NBA draft. Martin played two seasons in the NBA, averaging 3.0 points per game in 69 games for the Nuggets. Martin was then selected by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the 1989 NBA expansion draft, but never played for the team, and ended up retiring completely from the NBA at the age of just 24 due to chronic knee pain. He is still the only player from Sullivan County, NY to ever play in the NBA.\nFollowing his NBA career, he became a certified electrician and worked for the Pepsi Center for nearly 20 years as a supervisor that would transform the arena's playing surfacesIn 2016, he was diagnosed with Amyloidosis and as of 2020, is currently seeking a kidney transplant following complications of Amyloidosis.\nPassage 10:\nFrank Martin (cricketer)\nFrank Reginald \"Freddie\" Martin (12 October 1893 \u2013 23 November 1967) was a West Indian cricketer who played in West Indies' first Test in their inaugural Test tour of England. \nA left-handed batsman and slow left-arm bowler born in Kingston, Jamaica, Martin played domestic cricket for Jamaica. He played in every Test in both of the West Indies' first two Test tours, in England in 1928 and in Australia in 1930-31. In the fifth Test at Sydney of the 1930-31 tour, he scored 123 not out in the first innings against the strong Australian bowling of the day, part of the West Indies' 350 for 6.

It originated in the Middle East and has spread throughout Europe and beyond as a weed of cultivated fields and roadsides. The fruits are eaten as a supplement to diets in some parts of South Asia but are narcotic and potentially toxic in large quantities.\n\nDescription\nLathyrus aphaca, known as the yellow pea or yellow vetchling, is an annual species in the family Fabaceae (formerly Leguminosae). Plants grow to about 100 cm tall, are pale green to glaucous, glabrous, and have angled but unwinged stems. The leaves are reduced to simple (unbranched) tendrils and what look like leaves are actually stipules, which are ovate-hastate in shape and up to 50 mm long. The flowers are usually solitary and yellow (often streaked with violet), 10\u201313 mm in length, and held on long (up to 50 mm) stalks branching from the leaf axils. The flowers, which are bisexual, have 10 stamens and 1 style. Lathyrus aphaca is diploid, with 14 chromosomes.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nIt is believed to have evolved in the Middle East, around Syria and Jordan, along with other leguminous species which have a centre of diversity in that region. Edible species of pea were first cultivated in the Fertile Crescent, while weeds such as L. aphaca are believed to have adapted naturally to an arable or similar human-disturbed habitat between about 23,000 and 11,000 years ago. Lathyrus aphaca itself has some advantages as a farmland weed, being able to fix nitrogen and thus help to fertilise the soil, as well as being edible in small quantities if present in the grain harvest, although it is narcotic when consumed in larger amounts.\nThe native habitat of L. aphaca is most likely to be the dry, limestone scrubland in the Middle East sometimes known as phrygana or garrigue. In these countries it is found in both wild and cultivated habitats. It can be an aggressive agricultural weed, infesting mainly wheat, but also other crops, such as sugarcane in Pakistan. The expansion of farming over the last 10,000 years allowed L. aphaca to increase its range to southern Asia, as far as Bangladesh, and southern Europe as far as Portugal and even the Azores. In these regions it is often considered native, but it is more likely that it is an ancient introduction, or archaeophyte, which has found a natural or semi-natural analogue of its phrygana habitat, where it can persist in the wild. In Portugal it is considered native only in the Calcareous Western Centre biome, despite being present throughout the country as an agricultural weed. It is more likely that it is a well-established archaeophyte there.\nIn northern Europe, L. aphaca has not generally found any semi-natural analogue of its native arid scrub habitat. In Poland it is described as occurring \u2018in a different type of habitats, e.g. in the vegetation of forest edges representing the Trifolio-Geranietea sanguinei class, on dry lawns, transport route edges (especially along railway lines), in orchards, arable fields and fallows.'\nSince the early 20th century, it has gone into decline throughout Europe due to improved seed cleaning techniques, and it has largely been eradicated from cereal crops. In the Netherlands, it has declined by 75-100% since 1950, and in Germany and Poland there is a similar story. Meanwhile, however, it has become established as an agricultural weed further afield, in the United States, South Africa and Australia (GBIF, 2021).\n\nIn the United Kingdom\nIn Britain, L. aphaca has been recorded since 1632, when it was found by Thomas Johnson \u2018near Gravesend.\u2019 This is sufficiently early to earn it a place as either a native or a long-naturalised arable weed (archaeophyte), as opposed to a recent introduction neophyte. In the absence of any further information, therefore, British authors are free to describe it as a native or an introduced plant as they choose. A semi-natural habitat suggests that it is native, whereas an arable field says \u2018archaeophyte\u2019. Roadsides are difficult to interpret, and there are many weeds of roadsides which are considered native in various regions across Britain despite the obvious route of introduction. This uncertainty is nicely summed up by Rumsey, who writes \u2018[it] may be a long-established introduction rather than a native species\u2026 and may have been introduced as a seed contaminant of leguminous crops.\u2019 It is, however, usually treated as native and it is classified as VU (Vulnerable) in the Red List.In 2021 Natural England designated Swanscombe Peninsula in Kent a Site of Special Scientific Interest, partly for its population of yellow vetchling.\nPassage 2:\nLathyrus laevigatus\nLathyrus laevigatus is a flowering plant of the genus Lathyrus in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to middle, eastern, and southeastern Europe.\nPassage 3:\nLathyrus nissolia\nLathyrus nissolia, the grass vetchling or grass pea, is a species of flowering plant in the pea and bean family Fabaceae. It is native to most of Europe, Maghreb, Levant and the Caucasus. Despite its common names, it is not a grass, but belongs to the legume family Fabaceae.\n\nDescription\nGrass vetchling is an annual plant, with an erect stem branching from the base, and growing to a height of about 2 feet (0.7 m). It is entirely without true leaves, leaflets or tendrils. The leaf stalk, however, is flattened out until it closely resembles a blade of grass ending in a fine point, and the stipules at its base greatly help the deception.The crimson flowers come out in June and July, and are rather small, solitary and borne on a very long footstalk. They have the ability to self-pollinate.The flowers are succeeded by long, slender, straight pods, which are at first very flat, but become cylindrical when the contained peas are fully developed.\n\nHabitat\nGrassland, banks and field margins on neutral to acid soil.\n\nDistribution\nThe species is rare in Scotland and very localised in England and Wales, though there are signs that it is currently spreading in the United Kingdom. Not recorded from Ireland.\nPassage 4:\nLathyrus hirsutus\nLathyrus hirsutus is a species of wild pea known by several common names, including Caley pea, singletary pea, hairy vetchling, and Austrian winter pea.  It is native to Europe, North Africa, and much of Asia, and it is known from other continents, including North America, as an introduced species.  This is an annual herb producing a winged stem and leaves each made up of two leaflike leaflets with a branching, coiled tendril.  The inflorescence holds one or two pink, blue, or bicolored pea flowers each 1 to 1.5 centimeters wide.  The fruit is a dehiscent legume pod covered in hairs with each hair growing from a minute bulbous base.  The rest of the plant is generally hairless.\nPassage 5:\nLathyrus\nLathyrus  is a genus of flowering plants\nin the legume family Fabaceae, and contains approximately 160 species. Commonly known as peavines or vetchlings, they are native to temperate areas, with a breakdown of 52 species in Europe, 30 species in North America, 78 in Asia, 24 in tropical East Africa, and 24 in temperate South America. There are annual and perennial species which may be climbing or bushy.  This genus has numerous sections, including Orobus, which was once a separate genus.\n\nUses\nMany species are cultivated as garden plants. The genus includes the garden sweet pea (Lathyrus odoratus) and the perennial everlasting pea (Lathyrus latifolius). Flowers on these cultivated species may be rose, red, maroon, pink, white, yellow, purple or blue, and some are bicolored. They are also grown for their fragrance. Cultivated species are susceptible to fungal infections including downy and powdery mildew.\nOther species are grown for food, including the Indian pea (L. sativus) and the red pea (L. cicera), and less commonly cyprus-vetch (L. ochrus) and Spanish vetchling (L. clymenum). The tuberous pea (L. tuberosus) is grown as a root vegetable for its starchy edible tuber. The seeds of some Lathyrus species contain the toxic amino acid oxalyldiaminopropionic acid and if eaten in large quantities can cause lathyrism, a serious disease.\n\nDiversity\nSpecies include:\n\nEcology\nLathyrus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the grey chi (Antitype chi) and the latticed heath (Chiasmia clathrata), both recorded on meadow vetchling (Lathyrus pratensis), and Chionodes braunella. Lathyrus growth abundance and size both decrease in response to increased temperatures in montane meadows.\n\nNotes\nExternal links\n Media related to Lathyrus at Wikimedia Commons\nCalflora Database: Lathyrus species index\nJepson Flora Project: Key to Lathyrus\nPassage 6:\nLathyrus sylvestris\nLathyrus sylvestris, the flat pea or narrow-leaved everlasting-pea, is a species of flowering plant in the pea and bean family Fabaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, Europe, and Asia.The narrow-leaved everlasting-pea forms a mat of herbage. The stems are winged. Each leaf is made up of two elongated leaflets. The flowers are pink. The fruit is a legume pod about 2 inches long.\n\nDescription\nThe narrow-leaved everlasting-pea is a perennial plant which can grow 200 cm (79 in) by climbing with its tendrils. Without any support it can reach about 75 cm (30 in) tall. The stem is floppy and flat with wide wings. The leaves are alternate with short winged stalks and stipules. The leaf blades are pinnate with a single pair of narrow lanceolate leaflets with entire margins and three tendrils. The inflorescence has a long stem and three to ten pinkish-red flowers. These have five sepals and five petals and are irregular. The uppermost petal is known as the \"standard\", the lateral two as the \"wings\" and the lowest two are joined to form the \"keel\". There are ten stamens and a single carpel. The fruit is a long pod containing five to fifteen seeds.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThe narrow-leaved everlasting-pea is native to parts of Africa, Europe and Asia. Its natural habitat is forest edges, sparse broad-leaved hillside forests, dry hillside meadows, hedgerows, embankments and waste ground. It uses its tendrils to scramble over plants, shrubs and the lower branches of trees.\n\nUses\nThis plant is sometimes used to control erosion and for this purpose it is generally planted along with a grass species. It can do well in highly disturbed habitat. There is a cultivar called 'Lathco'.\nPassage 7:\nDichroa\nDichroa is a genus of 12 species of flowering plants in the family Hydrangeaceae, native to eastern and southeastern Asia. They are deciduous shrubs growing to 1\u20133 m tall, with their leaves arranged in opposite pairs. The flowers are produced in a broad inflorescence similar to that of the related genus Hydrangea. The fruit is a glossy metallic purple-blue berry.\nDichroa febrifuga (Chinese: \u5e38\u5c71; pinyin: ch\u00e1ngsh\u0101n) is an important herb in traditional Chinese medicine, where it is considered one of the 50 fundamental herbs.\nSelected speciesDichroa daimingshanensis Y.C.Wu\nDichroa febrifuga Lour.\nDichroa hirsuta Gagnep.\nDichroa mollissima Merrill\nDichroa versicolour\nDichroa yaoshanensis Y.C.Wu\nDichroa yunnanensis S.M.Hwang\nPassage 8:\nSweet pea\nThe sweet pea, Lathyrus odoratus, is a flowering plant in the genus Lathyrus in the family Fabaceae (legumes), native to Sicily, southern Italy and the Aegean Islands.It is an annual climbing plant, growing to a height of 1\u20132 metres (3 ft 3 in \u2013 6 ft 7 in), where suitable support is available. The leaves are pinnate with two leaflets and a terminal tendril, which twines around supporting plants and structures, helping the sweet pea to climb. In the wild plant the flowers are purple, 2\u20133.5 cm (3\u20444\u20131+1\u20442 in) broad; they are larger and highly variable in color in the many cultivars. Flowers are usually strongly scented.\nThe annual species, L. odoratus, may be confused with the everlasting pea, L. latifolius, a perennial.\n\nHorticultural development\nScottish nurseryman Henry Eckford (1823\u20131905) cross-bred and developed the sweet pea, turning it from a rather insignificant if sweetly scented flower into a floral sensation of the 19th century.\nHis initial success and recognition came while serving as head gardener for the Earl of Radnor, raising new cultivars of pelargoniums and dahlias. In 1870 he went to work for one Dr. Sankey of Sandywell near Gloucester. A member of the Royal Horticultural Society, he was awarded a First Class Certificate (the top award) in 1882 for introducing the sweet pea cultivar 'Bronze Prince', marking the start of association with the flower. In 1888 he set up his development and trial fields for sweet peas in Wem in Shropshire. By 1901, he had introduced a total of 115 of the 264 cultivars grown at the time. Eckford was presented with the RHS Victoria Medal of Honour for his work. He died in 1906, but his work was continued for a time by his son John Eckford.\nMore recently, the association between the sweet pea, the Eckfords and Wem has been highlighted again. In the late 1980s, the Sweet Pea Society of Wem started an annual show. Many of the street signs now carry a sweet-pea motif, and an area of the town is known as Eckford Park. There is also a cultivar 'Dorothy Eckford', named after a family member.\n\nCultivation\nSweet peas have been cultivated since the 17th century and a vast number of cultivars are commercially available. They are grown for their flower colour (usually in pastel shades of blue, pink, purple and white, including bi-colours), and for their intense unique fragrance.  They are grown by gardeners for private enjoyment or for exhibition, and in the floristry trade. The large, pea-shaped seeds are sown in cold frames in Spring or Autumn.  The seeds benefit from pre-soaking or chipping with a sharp blade. The plants are also available later in the season, as young plants or plugs. They are grown up canes, with the new shoots being regularly pinched out to promote a bushy habit and higher flower yields. Plants typically reach heights of 1-2m, with the flowers appearing in midsummer and continuing for many weeks if regularly deadheaded.Over 50 cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\nSee List of AGM sweet peas\n\nPests and diseases\nThe sweet pea plant does suffer from some pests, the most common being aphids. These insects suck the sap out of the plants, reducing growth. Mosaic virus is spread by greenfly, causing yellowing of leaves, distortion of new shoots, and inhibited flowering.\nA pest called the pollen beetle which is small, shiny and black, eats the pollen and disfigures the flowers. Other pests include caterpillars, thrips, slugs and snails. Another problem is mildew; this is a white powdery coating that covers the leaves and slows down growth. When sweet peas are planted too close to each other it causes fungal diseases like powdery mildew. Such fungus suck nutrients from sweet peas and stunt their growth.The sweet pea is also susceptible to ethylene in quantities produced by senescing plants. Because of this, growers are encouraged to plant sweet peas away from fruit trees among other plants prone to early dieback or senescence.\n\nToxicity\nUnlike the edible pea, there is evidence that seeds of members of the genus Lathyrus are toxic if ingested in quantity. A related species, Lathyrus sativus, is grown for human consumption but when it forms a major part of the diet it causes symptoms of toxicity called lathyrism.In studies of rats, animals fed a diet of 50% sweet pea seeds developed enlarged adrenals relative to control animals fed on edible peas. The main effect is thought to be on the formation of collagen. Symptoms are similar to those of scurvy and copper deficiency, which share the common feature of inhibiting proper formation of collagen fibrils. Seeds of the sweet pea contain beta-aminopropionitrile that prevents the cross-linking of collagen by inhibiting lysyl oxidase and thus the formation of allysine, leading to loose skin. Recent experiments have attempted to develop this chemical as a treatment to avoid disfiguring skin contractions after skin grafting.\n\nGenetics\nGregor Mendel is today recognized as the \"Father of Modern Genetics\" for his work with the cross breeding of pea plants (Pisum sativum) with different characteristics, and sweet pea has been used in a similar way. The sweet pea is thus a model organism being used in early experimentations in genetics, particularly by the pioneer geneticist Reginald Punnett. It is highly suitable as a genetic subject because of its ability to self-pollinate and its easily observed Mendelian traits such as colour, height and petal form. Many genetic principles were discovered or confirmed in this species. It was used by Punnett in early studies of genetic linkage. Complementary factor inheritance was also elucidated in sweet peas, from the cross of two pure-breeding white strains which gave rise to a blue hybrid, the blue colour requiring two genes derived independently from the two white parents.\n\nHybridization with Lathyrus belinensis\nLike the blue rose, the yellow sweet pea remains elusive. Lathyrus belinensis is a related Lathyrus species which has red and yellow flowers. There are ongoing attempts to bring the yellow color into Lathyrus odoratus by crossing it with Lathyrus belinensis. Several new sweet pea cultivars have been created as a result, though not any with the yellow flower color so far.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of AGM sweet peas - list of sweet peas that have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit\nPassage 9:\nLathyrus cicera\nLathyrus cicera is a species of wild pea known by the common names red pea, red vetchling and flatpod peavine. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, and it is known from other places as an introduced species. This is a hairless annual herb producing a slightly winged stem. The leaves are each made up of two leaflike linear leaflets 3 to 6 centimeters (1.2 to 2.4 in) long. They also bear branched, curling tendrils. The inflorescence holds a single pea flower 1 to 1.5 centimeters (0.39 to 0.59 in) wide which is a varying shade of red. The fruit is a hairless dehiscent legume pod.\nThis is one pea species known to cause lathyrism; nevertheless, as cicerchia it figured among the comestibles enjoyed by the fortunate Milanese, listed at length by Bonvesin de la Riva in his \"Marvels of Milan\" (1288).\nPassage 10:\nLathyrus vernus\nLathyrus vernus, the spring vetchling, spring pea, or spring vetch, is a species of flowering herbaceous perennial plant in the genus Lathyrus, native to forests of Europe and Siberia. It forms a dense clump of pointed leaves with purple flowers in spring, shading to a greenish-blue with age.This species, and the cultivar 'Alboroseus', have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\nDescription\nLathyrus vernus is a perennial plant with an upright stem without wings. The stem grows to 20 to 40 cm (8 to 16 in) and is erect and nearly hairless. The leaves are alternate with short stalks and large, wide stipules. The leaf blades are pinnate with two to four pairs of ovate tapering  leaflets with blunt tips, entire margins and no tendrils. The inflorescence has a long stem and three to ten purplish-red flowers, each 13 to 20 mm (0.5 to 0.8 in) long, turning bluer as they age. These have five sepals and five petals and are irregular. The uppermost petal is known as the \"standard\", the lateral two as the \"wings\" and the lowest two are joined to form the \"keel\". There are ten stamens and a single carpel. The fruit is a long brown pod up to 60 mm (2.4 in) in length containing eight to fourteen seeds which are poisonous. This plant flowers early in the year, in May and June. It can be distinguished from bitter vetch (L. linifolius) and black pea (L. niger) by the breadth of its ovate leaflets. It does not wither after flowering but continues to grow until autumn.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nLathyrus vernus is native to Europe and parts of northern Asia. Its typical habitat is broad-leaved woodland, forest margins, plantations and clearings.", "answers": ["no"], "incorrect_answer": "Yes"}, {"input": "What occupation have Carly Gullickson and Francesca Schiavone both held?", "context": "Passage 1:\nFrancesca Schiavone\nFrancesca Schiavone (Italian pronunciation: [fran\u02c8t\u0283eska skja\u02c8vo\u02d0ne]; born 23 June 1980) is an Italian former tennis player. She turned professional in 1998 and won the 2010 French Open singles title, becoming the first Italian woman to win a Grand Slam event in singles. She was also runner-up at the 2011 French Open. Her career-high ranking is world No. 4, achieved on 31 January 2011. To date, Schiavone is the last one-handed-backhand player to win a Grand Slam title on the women's tour.She won eight career singles titles in total, seven on the WTA Tour and one at Roland Garros. In doubles, her career-high ranking is world No. 8, peaking with an appearance in the final of the 2008 French Open. Furthermore, she helped Italy to win the Fed Cup in 2006, 2009 and 2010, and has the most wins for the Italian team.\nSchiavone played in the longest ever women's singles match at a Grand Slam tournament, when she defeated Svetlana Kuznetsova 6\u20134, 1\u20136, 16\u201314 in the fourth round of the 2011 Australian Open women's singles draw, the match lasted 4 hours and 44 minutes and in the process secured her first and only quarterfinal at the Australian Open.On 5 September 2018, Schiavone announced her retirement from tennis at the US Open. During the announcement, she shared aspirations of winning a Grand Slam as a coach. In April 2021, Schiavone began coaching Petra Marti\u0107.\n\nPersonal life\nSchiavone was born in Milan to Franco Schiavone, from Manocalzati in the Province of Avellino, Campania, Southern Italy, and to Luiscita Minelli, from Bornato in the Province of Brescia, Northern Italy.\n\nPlaying style\nSchiavone employs an all-court game and has a very classic approach to her clay game. She uses an extreme eastern grip on her one-handed backhand. Chris Fowler and Brad Gilbert described her forehand as a \"buggy whip.\"\n\nEndorsements\nSchiavone was endorsed by multiple companies throughout her professional career. From 2004, she was endorsed by Diadora for clothing and apparel, before switching to Lotto in 2007. She switched to Adidas in 2013; due to a series of poor results, she was dropped by the company, moving to Asics in 2014, remaining with Asics for the rest of her professional career. For racquets, Schiavone used Yonex racquets until 2006; in that year, she switched to Babolat, using the Pure Aero racquet until her retirement in 2018.\n\nProfessional career\nSchiavone won eight singles titles and also achieved eleven runner-up positions, eight of them since the autumn of 2005. She lost her first eight career finals on the WTA Tour before finally winning her first title in July 2007. She and her Italian teammates Mara Santangelo, Flavia Pennetta and Roberta Vinci beat the Belgian team 3\u20132 in the 2006 Fed Cup final. Justine Henin had to retire in the fifth and final match due to an injury in her right knee, which let Italy win their first Fed Cup trophy. This match was a doubles match and Kirsten Flipkens partnered Henin, and Roberta Vinci partnered Schiavone. In 2009, she won the Fed Cup with Italy for the second time against the US, and also made the quarterfinals of Wimbledon for the first time. In 2010, Italy with Schiavone won the Fed Cup for the third time.\nIn addition, she realized a notable victory during the quarterfinals of the 2008 Dubai Open, when she upset world No. 1 and four-time champion Henin 7\u20136, 7\u20136. She also beat Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo in a Fed Cup tie in 2006 when Mauresmo was ranked No. 1.\nPartnering with Australian Casey Dellacqua, Schiavone was the runner-up in the women's doubles competition at the 2008 French Open where they lost to Anabel Medina Garrigues and Virginia Ruano Pascual. Schiavone also reached the semifinals of the doubles event at the other three Grand Slam tournaments.\n\n2010: First major title at Roland Garros\nAt the Australian Open, Francesca defeated Frenchwomen Aliz\u00e9 Cornet 0\u20136, 7\u20135, 6\u20130, and Julie Coin 6\u20133, 6\u20134 first before upsetting No. 10 seed Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska 6\u20132, 6\u20132. Though she matched her best results there (round four), she went on to lose to No. 6 seed Venus Williams after winning the first set, 6\u20133, 2\u20136, 1\u20136.\nShe beat Alberta Brianti, Tathiana Garbin, Carla Su\u00e1rez Navarro, Yaroslava Shvedova, and Roberta Vinci all in straight sets to win her third WTA title at the Barcelona Ladies Open.\nSeeded 17th entering the French Open, Schiavone was lightly regarded as a contender for the championship. She defeated Regina Kulikova, Sophie Ferguson, 11th seed Li Na, and 30th seed Maria Kirilenko to reach her first French Open quarterfinal since 2001 (where she had lost to Martina Hingis). There, she defeated world No. 3, Caroline Wozniacki, in straight sets to become the first Italian woman to reach the semifinals of a Grand Slam singles event.\nThe semifinals of the French Open consisted of four players (Jelena Jankovi\u0107, Elena Dementieva, Samantha Stosur and Schiavone) who had never won a Grand Slam singles event; nevertheless, most in the tennis community, including ESPN's tennis commentary team of Mary Joe Fern\u00e1ndez, Patrick McEnroe, and Brad Gilbert singled out Schiavone as the one player who was not a serious contender to win the title. In the semifinals, Schiavone defeated world No. 5 and 2004 finalist, Dementieva (she retired in the second set with a torn calf muscle having lost the first set in a tiebreaker), and the victory made Schiavone the first Italian woman to reach a Grand Slam final, and assured that she would become a top-ten player for the first time following the tournament.\nIn the final, Schiavone faced Stosur in a rematch of their first-round meeting at the 2009 French Open which Stosur had won easily (6\u20134, 6\u20132). Because of this previous result, and Stosur's victories over four-time French Open champion Justine Henin, world No. 1 Serena Williams and world No. 4 Jankovi\u0107 en route to the final, Stosur was considered a heavy favorite. However, on 5 June 2010, Schiavone defied expectations to become the first Italian woman to win a Grand Slam singles title, beating Stosur 6\u20134, 7\u20136. The victory made her only the third Italian player to win a Grand Slam event in singles, after Nicola Pietrangeli and Adriano Panatta. She also became the oldest woman to win a first Grand Slam title in the Open Era, beating the previous record by Jana Novotn\u00e1. The victory also meant she rose to No. 6 in the world rankings on 7 June 2010 and became the highest-ranked Italian woman ever, after Flavia Pennetta reached world No. 10 in 2009.\nSchiavone's next event was Eastbourne, where she lost in the first round to Sorana C\u00eerstea, 5\u20137, 3\u20136. As the fifth seed at Wimbledon, due to the pre-tournament withdrawal of Dementieva, she lost to Vera Dushevina in the first round, 7\u20136, 5\u20137, 1\u20136.\nSchiavone reached the quarterfinals of the Rogers Cup, where she fell to top seed Caroline Wozniacki. She was the sixth seed at the US Open, and defeated Ayumi Morita, Maria Elena Camerin, 29th seed Alona Bondarenko, and 20th seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova to advance to the quarterfinals for the first time since 2003 (where she had lost to Jennifer Capriati). In the quarterfinals, she fell to seven-time Grand Slam singles champion and No. 3 seed Venus Williams, 6\u20137, 4\u20136.\nAs the fifth seed, Schiavone reached the semifinals of the Pan Pacific Open, where she fell to seventh seed Elena Dementieva. At the season-ending Tour Championships, Schiavone competed for the first time in her career but was eliminated in the round-robin stage. She fell to Caroline Wozniacki in three sets, and Sam Stosur in two sets before defeating Elena Dementieva in what would be Dementieva's final career match.\n\n2011\nSchiavone began the year at the Hopman Cup representing Italy. In singles, she defeated Laura Robson, but fell to Bethanie Mattek-Sands. Schiavone retired with an injury against Kristina Mladenovic.\nSeeded sixth at the Australian Open, Schiavone advanced to the quarterfinals for the first time in her career upon a victory over 23rd-seeded and two-time Grand Slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova. The fourth-round encounter lasted nearly five hours (4:44; 47 games in total), and Schiavone saved six match points before finally prevailing 6\u20134, 1\u20136, 16\u201314. With this win, Schiavone rose in the rankings to world No. 4 after the tournament, the highest ranking ever achieved by an Italian woman, improving her own record. In the quarterfinal against world No. 1, Caroline Wozniacki, Schiavone was a set and 3\u20131 up in the second set, but was broken twice by Wozniacki in the same set and twice in the third, to lose 6\u20133, 3\u20136, 3\u20136 after saving three match points.\nAt the Dubai Tennis Championships, Schiavone was seeded third, but fell in the round of 16 to Kuznetsova. At the Qatar Open in Doha, she fell to Peng Shuai in the round of 16. She then fell to eventual champion Jelena Dokic at the Malaysian Open. Schiavone then reached the round of 16 again at the Indian Wells Open, falling to Shahar Pe'er. Seeded fifth at the Miami Open, she reached the round of 16, losing to Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska.\nSchiavone began her clay-court season with a round of 16 loss to Radwa\u0144ska at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix. She then reached the round of 16 at the Madrid Open, falling to Mattek-Sands. Following Madrid, Schiavone reached the quarterfinals of the Italian Open, losing to world No. 7, Sam Stosur, in a rematch of the 2010 French Open final. She then lost to world No. 1, Caroline Wozniacki, in three sets during the semifinals of the Brussels Open, the last tournament before the French Open.\nSchiavone was the fifth seed and defending champion at the French Open. She beat Melanie Oudin, Vesna Dolonts, 29th seed Peng Shuai, tenth seed Jelena Jankovi\u0107, 14th seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, and 11th seed Marion Bartoli to reach the final where she lost to Li Na, 4\u20136, 6\u20137.She then switched to the grass courts, falling to Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska at the Eastbourne International in her only Wimbledon warmup. She was the sixth seed at the Wimbledon Championships, losing in the third round to Tamira Paszek of Austria.During the Canadian Open, Schiavone won her opening-round match against Ekaterina Makarova but fell in the third round to Lucie \u0160af\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1.\nThe Western & Southern Open saw another early round loss for Schiavone. It took her three sets to defeat Maria Kirilenko in her opening round match. She then lost to former world No. 1, Jelena Jankovi\u0107, in a third round three-setter.\nJust before the US Open Schiavone entered the New Haven Open. She defeated Alexandra Dulgheru and Monica Niculescu in the first two rounds. Her quarterfinal match against Anabel Medina Garrigues was a walkover. Schiavone was defeated by Wozniacki in straight sets in the semifinals.\nAt the US Open, she reached the fourth round where she lost to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. At the China Open Schiavone emerged victorious in the first round against Bojana Jovanovski but was then defeated in the second round by Dominika Cibulkov\u00e1.\n\n2012\nSchiavone began the season at the Brisbane International. Seeded third, she reached the semifinal where she lost to eventual champion Kaia Kanepi.Schiavone struggled whilst representing Italy at Fed Cup versus Ukraine, losing to a non-top-100 player Lesia Tsurenko comprehensively 1\u20136, 2\u20136 and barely getting past Kateryna Bondarenko, 6\u20137, 7\u20135, 6\u20134. Despite her struggles, Italy still managed to progress through to the semifinals.\nSchiavone played in the mini gulf series in Doha and Dubai losing early in both of them as the seventh seed; Doha in the second round to Yanina Wickmayer 4\u20136, 6\u20137 and in her Dubai opener to Ana Ivanovic 1\u20136, 5\u20137.\nAt the Indian Wells Open, she (as 10th seed) avenged her Fed Cup loss by beating Lesia Tsurenko, 6\u20132, 6\u20134, before retiring against Lucie \u0160af\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1 in the third round after losing the first set 6\u20132. With the same seeding in Miami, she lost to Ksenia Pervak 4\u20136, 6\u20134, 5\u20137 in her opener, blowing a 3\u20130 final-set lead.\nAfter lackluster results, the clay-court season was a chance for Schiavone to get back on form on her favorite surface, but as the top seed at the Barcelona Open, her poor form continued as she lost to Olga Govorstova in her opening match. She represented Italy in Fed Cup semifinals against Czech Republic, losing both of her matches to Lucie \u0160af\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1 and to Petra Kvitov\u00e1. Italy lost the tie 1\u20134. After passing her opening round in Stuttgart against Monica Niculescu, she lost in the second round to No. 3 seed Petra Kvitov\u00e1, in straight sets. She also lost her opener in Madrid to Varvara Lepchenko and Rome to Ekaterina Makarova. However, Schiavone finally found some form going into the French Open, winning Strasbourg by defeating Sloane Stephens and Aliz\u00e9 Cornet in the semifinals and finals, respectively.\nSchiavone reached the third round of French Open, where she lost to Varvara Lepchenko.At Wimbledon, she reached the fourth round, before losing to Petra Kvitov\u00e1 in three sets but managed to reach the semifinals in doubles with partner Flavia Pennetta. Schaivone won her opening match at the Olympics and was then ousted in the second round by Vera Zvonareva.\nSeeded 22nd, Schiavone faced off against Sloane Stephens in the first round of the US Open and lost in straight sets. Schiavone then competed at the Pan Pacific Open where she defeated Yaroslava Shvedova in the first round but then lost to Sam Stosur. She then suffered three consecutive first-round losses to Li Na at Beijing, to Olga Puchkova at Osaka and to Urszula Radwa\u0144ska at Moscow.\n\nCareer statistics\nGrand Slam tournament performance timelines\nSingles\nDoubles\nGrand Slam tournament finals\nSingles: 2 (1 title, 1 runner-up)\nDoubles: 1 (runner-up)\nPassage 2:\n2006 Generali Ladies Linz \u2013 Doubles\nGisela Dulko and Kv\u011bta Peschke were the defending champions, but competed this year with different partners.

Its lands area combination of open fields and woodland, with the cluster of farm buildings set around the junction of Upland and Crossman Roads.  It includes three houses, built roughly between 1760 and 1836, as well as several barns, stables, and other outbuildings.  A prominent feature of the complex is a pair of circular silos, set close to the road junction in front of one of the barns.The history of these farm properties dates to the early 18th century, and the earliest period of New Milford's settlement.  Daniel Hine, a native Milford, settled in New Milford in 1737, and soon had a farm established here.  Abel Buckingham began farming land adjacent to Hines's in 1775.  The oldest of the three surviving houses was built about 1760 by Daniel Hines.  By the mid-19th century, both families were engaged in  dairy farming, sending their products to market via the Housatonic Railroad.  The Hines farm was sold out of the family in 1908, while that of the Buckinghams remained in that family until 1972, when it was sold to the Hendersons.  The Hines farm was purchased by the Hendersons in 1968, and the combined property was adapted by them to its present use as a culinary school and arts center.\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Litchfield County, Connecticut\nPassage 2:\nGreen Hill Farm\nGreen Hill Farm was a 2,000-acre (8.1 km2) horse farm in Burlington Township, Burlington County, New Jersey, United States. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The land was owned and operated by families out of Burlington and Philadelphia. First, Green Hill was owned by Samuel Jennings, the acting Governor of West Jersey. Jennings purchased the property in 1681 and gave it the name Green Hill. It is possible that he named it after Green Hill near Kenilworth, Evesham in Worcester, England though there is not conclusive proof of this. In 1791, John Smith bought 340 acres (1.4 km2) of the Jennings property. The famous brick house located there was built between 1800 and 1803. The frame tenant house was the home of various families to work on the farm. The 9.5 acres that remain of Green Hill was purchased by Stephen and Helen Matlaga in 1973.

Its first issue was published in October 1945.  It was named after the 1936 film by Charlie Chaplin.Les Temps Modernes filled the void left by the disappearance of the most important pre-war literary magazine, La Nouvelle Revue Fran\u00e7aise (The New French Review), considered to be Andr\u00e9 Gide's magazine, which was shut down by the authorities after the liberation of France because of its collaboration with the occupation.Les Temps Modernes was first published by Gallimard and was last published by Gallimard. In between, the magazine changed hands three times: Julliard (January 1949 to September 1965), Presses d'aujourd'hui (October 1964 to March 1985), Gallimard (from April 1985). Les Temps Modernes ceased publication in 2019, after 74 years.\n\nEarly history\nThe first editorial board consisted of Sartre (director), Raymond Aron, Simone de Beauvoir, Michel Leiris, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Albert Ollivier, and Jean Paulhan. All published many articles for the magazine. Sartre's contributions included \"La nationalisation de la litt\u00e9rature\" (\"The Nationalisation of Literature\"), \"Mat\u00e9rialisme et r\u00e9volution\" (\"Materialism and Revolution\"), and \"Qu'est-ce-que la litt\u00e9rature?\" (\"What is Literature?\"). Simone de Beauvoir first published Le Deuxi\u00e8me Sexe (\"The Second Sex\") in Les Temps Modernes.In the preface to the first edition, Sartre stated the review's purpose: to publish litt\u00e9rature engag\u00e9e. This philosophy of literature expresses a basic creed of existentialism\u2014that an individual is responsible for making conscious decisions to commit socially useful acts. Thus, literature in the magazine would have a utilitarian component; it would not be just culturally valuable (\"art for art's sake\"). Other intellectuals, such as Andr\u00e9 Gide, Andr\u00e9 Breton, and Louis Aragon, disapproved of this orientation.  Sartre's response: \"Le monde peut fort bien se passer de la litt\u00e9rature. Mais il peut se passer de l'homme encore mieux.\" (\"The world can easily get along without literature. But it can get along even more easily without man.\")The works of many writers appeared in Les Temps Modernes. They include Richard Wright, Jean Genet, Nathalie Sarraute, Boris Vian, and Samuel Beckett.Political divisions between board members soon surfaced. Raymond Aron quit in 1945 because of the magazine's Communist sympathies, becoming an editor at Le Figaro. At the time of the Korean War of 1950\u20131953, Merleau-Ponty resigned. Originally more supportive of Communism than Sartre, he moved progressively to the right as Sartre moved to the left. At the time, Sartre still endorsed Communism in his writings but in private expressed his reservations.Sartre disapproved of Camus for seeing both sides in the Algerians' rebellion against their French colonial masters (The Algerian War\u20141954\u201362). In his bitterness against Camus, Sartre selected Francis Jeanson, who did not like the works of Camus, to review the Camus essay L'Homme R\u00e9volt\u00e9 (The Rebel). When Camus responded to the review with hurt feelings, Sartre put the final blow to a friendship that had lasted for years. He said, \"Vous \u00eates devenu la proie d'une morne d\u00e9mesure qui masque vos difficult\u00e9s int\u00e9rieures. ... T\u00f4t ou tard, quelqu'un vous l'e\u00fbt dit, autant que ce soit moi.\" (\"You have become the victim of an excessive sullenness that masks your internal problems. ... Sooner or later, someone would have told you, so it might as well be me.\")\n\n1960\u20132019\nLes Temps Modernes enjoyed its greatest influence in the 1960s. At this time, it had more than 20,000 subscribers. During the Algerian War (1954\u20131962) it strongly supported the National Liberation Front, the primary group in the ultimately successful battle against the French. It fiercely denounced the extensive use of torture by French forces, opposed de Gaulle's government, and supported desertion and resistance to conscription. The journal printed testimonies by French soldiers denouncing the war and torture from 1958 to 1962. For this, it was censured and its premises seized.From its inception the review has published many special issues. These include Sartre's 1946 description of the United States, an attempt to discredit the myths that many of the French held about this country. In 1955, Claude Lanzmann described Sartre's Marxist philosophy in an issue called  \"La Gauche\" (\"The Left\"). An issue on \"La r\u00e9volte hongroise\" (\"The Hungarian Rebellion\") (1956\u201357) denounced Soviet repression. In 1967, at the time of the Six-Day War, an issue, \"Le conflit isra\u00e9lo-arabe\" (\"The Israeli-Arab conflict\"), contained articles by both Israelis and Arabs. In 1977, North African writers led by Abdelkebir Khatibi published the edition Du Maghreb. In 2001, a special edition was devoted to Serge Doubrovsky.From 2016, the chief editor of Les Temps Modernes was Claude Lanzmann until his death on 5 July 2018, after a short illness. The editorial board consisted of Juliette Simont (Editorial Assistant to Lanzmann), Adrien Barrot, Jean Bourgault, Joseph Cohen, Michel Deguy, Liliane Kandel, Jean Khalfa, Patrice Maniglier, Robert Redeker, Marc Sagnol, G\u00e9rard Wormser, and Raphael Zagury-Orly. It was published bimonthly.In 2019, following Lanzmann's death, Les Temps Modernes ceased publishing, after 74 years.\nPassage 2:\nAnne Looby\nAnne Looby is an Australian actress, producer and stage director.

She is a philosophy professor.  The meeting between the two women was recounted in the book Tout compte fait, which Simone de Beauvoir dedicated to Le Bon.\nLe Bon was one of the women that de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre cared and provided for. Sylvie Le Bon and Simone de Beauvoir met in 1960, when Le Bon was 17 and de Beauvoir was 52. De Beauvoir legally adopted Le Bon in 1980, making her the sole executor of her will.After the death of Simone de Beauvoir in 1986, Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir published several volumes of letters:\n\nLettres \u00e0 Sartre - an anthology of the letters between Simone de Beauvoir and Sartre\nLettres \u00e0 Nelson Algren\nCorrespondance crois\u00e9e (Simone de Beauvoir and Jacques-Laurent Bost)\nAnne, ou quand prime le spirituel (republication of Simone's first novel)\nPassage 4:\nOlga Kosakiewicz\nOlga Kosakiewicz (Ukrainian: \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u0437\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447; 6 November 1915 \u2013 1983) was a French theater actress.\n\nBiography\nShe and her sister Wanda Kosakiewicz were born in Kyiv as daughters of the Frenchwoman Marthe Kosakiewicz and the Belarusian emigrant from Kyiv Victor Kosakiewicz. After the October Revolution, the family migrated to L'Aigle, where the father acquired and operated a saw mill.\nOlga Kosakiewicz visited the Lyc\u00e9e Joan of Arc in Rouen, where she was taught by Colette Audry and in 1932 presented to Simone de Beauvoir, in  1934  when Jean-Paul Sartre returned from a study visit from the German Reich she was also presented to him. At the end of the school year 1934 she passed her Baccalaur\u00e9at as best. From autumn 1934 to 1936 she studied medicine at the University of Rouen, then lived in Paris. From 1934 to 1935 Beauvoir and from 1935 to 1937 Sartre had an affair with her. Her irrepressible, rebellious character, characterized by emotional high and low, her authenticity and spontaneity charmed Sartre and Beauvoir.\nShe joined the circle of de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. \nIn de Beauvoir's first novel L'Invit\u00e9e, she and her sister, Wanda, were fused together to make the character of the younger friend Xavi\u00e8re, to form with the actress Fran\u00e7oise and the actor, director Pierre a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois.Olga, along with Bianca Lamblin and Natalie Sorokin, later stated that their \"trio\" relationships with Sartre and de Beauvoir damaged them psychologically.A motivation of Sartre to write the play The Flies was to give Kosakiewicz an opportunity for a debut as a theater actress. The Flies should have premiered at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise, but the intendant Jean-Louis Barrault did not agree to Sartre's condition that Olga Kosakiewicz should assume the role of Electra. So it was premiered on June 3, 1943 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Cit\u00e9 internationale (aka Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Sarah Bernhardt).\nIn 1946 in Simone de Beauvoir's unique Drama Les Bouches inutiles she played Clarice the daughter  of Catherine and Louis d'Avesnes the main characters.\nIn Sartre's trilogy of novels, Les Chemins de la Libert\u00e9 (The Roads to Freedom), the character of Ivich is considered a representation of Olga. Deirdre Bair's biography of Simone de Beauvoir examines this relationship. Hazel Rowley also discusses it at length in her book about the relationship between Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre.\nIn 1946 Olga married Jacques-Laurent Bost, a long-time lover of de Beauvoir. She died of tuberculosis in 1983.\n\nSee also\nBianca Lamblin\nNatalie Sorokin\n\nNotes\nPassage 5:\nThe Ethics of Ambiguity\nThe Ethics of Ambiguity (French: Pour une morale de l'ambigu\u00eft\u00e9) is Simone de Beauvoir's second major non-fiction work.  It was prompted by a lecture she gave in 1945, after which she claimed that it was impossible to base an ethical system on her partner Jean-Paul Sartre's major philosophical work Being and Nothingness (French: L'\u00catre et le n\u00e9ant). The following year, over a six-month period, she took on the challenge, publishing the resulting text first as installments in Les Temps modernes and then, in November 1947, as a book.\n\nContents\nThe Ethics of Ambiguity consists of three parts and a short conclusion.\n\nPart I\n\"Ambiguity and Freedom,\" lays out the philosophical underpinnings of Beauvoir's stance on ethics.  She asserts that a person is fundamentally free, a freedom that comes from one's own \"nothingness,\" which is an essential aspect of one's ability to be self-aware, to be conscious of oneself: \"... the nothingness which is at the heart of man is also the consciousness that he has of himself.\" But each person is also a thing, a \"facticity,\" an object for others. The ambiguity is that each of us is both subject and object, freedom and facticity. As free, we have the ability to take note of ourselves and choose what to do. As factic, we are constrained by physical limits, social barriers and the expectations and political power of others.\nBeauvoir rejects any notion of an absolute goodness or moral imperative that exists on its own. \"...there exists no absolute value before the passion of man, outside of it, in relation to which one might distinguish the useless from the useful.\" Values come only from our choices.Human freedom can be only in concrete projects, not in the abstract. Freedom \"requires the realization of concrete ends, of particular projects.\"The types of particular content that are suitable are discussed in Part III.\n\nPart II\nPart II, \"Personal Freedom and Others,\" examines a number of different ways that people try to deny their freedom, as freedom can be uncomfortable and disquieting.  The freedom to choose entails the freedom to try to avoid one's freedom.  Before we can even do that, however, we start as children, who take the values of the adults around them as ready-made things.  She calls this the attitude of \"seriousness,\" in which the child \"escapes the anguish of freedom\" by thinking of values as existing objectively, outside themselves, rather than as an expression of their freedom. Once past childhood, one can be a sub-man who avoids all questions of freedom and assumes themselves not free.  The next rung up the hierarchy is the serious man who \"gets rid of his freedom by claiming to subordinate it to values which would be unconditioned,\" in effect reverting to a kind of childhood. Both the sub-man and the serious man refuse to recognize that they are free, in the sense of being able to choose their own values.\nSeveral other types recognize their freedom, but misuse it.  The nihilist, having failed at life, decides not to try anything at all.  \"Conscious of being unable to be anything, man then decides to be nothing. ... Nihilism is disappointed seriousness which has turned back upon itself.\" The adventurer is one who engages vigorously in various life projects, but without caring for the goal.  The adventurer \"does not attach himself to the end at which he aims; only to his conquest. He likes action for its own sake.\" And they trample on others in the process: \"[T]he adventurer shares the nihilist\u2019s contempt for men.\" Finally the passionate man cares enthusiastically about his goal, but shares a similar contempt for others: \"Not intending his freedom for men, the passionate man does not recognize them as freedoms either. He will not hesitate to treat them as things.\"And finally there is genuine freedom, which takes the excitement of the adventurer and the passion of the passionate man and includes with them a concern for other people, other freedoms, as well. \"Passion is converted to genuine freedom only if one destines his existence to other existences.\"  \"To will oneself free is also to will others free.\"\n\nPart III\nPart III, \"The Positive Aspect of Ambiguity,\" examines the intricacies and nuances of genuinely free action in the world.  It includes five sections.\n\nPart III, Section 1, \"The Aesthetic Attitude,\" criticizes the attitude of detached contemplation as being unworkable.Part III, Section 2, \"Freedom and Liberation,\" explores the evils of oppression and offers a number of trenchant observations about the relationship between the oppressor and the oppressed.  The oppressor recognizes the interdependence of people, but treats those of the oppressed class as things, not as free human existents in their own right. To prevent them from rebelling, the oppressor tries to mystify them into thinking that the oppressive situation is just natural.  But it is not, and \"the oppressed can fulfill his freedom as a man only in revolt ....\"Part III, Section 3, \"The Antinomies of Action,\" examines the need for violence and its consequent moral quandaries. \"In order for a liberating action to be a thoroughly moral action, it would have to be achieved through a conversion of the oppressors: there would then be a reconciliation of all freedoms. But no one any longer dares to abandon himself today to these utopian reveries.\" Under what circumstances, then, is violence justified?  Under what circumstances may the oppressed treat the oppressors as less than fully human in order to secure their own liberation? Beauvoir considers in some detail the nuances and difficulties of such considerations.Part III, Section 4, \"The Present and the Future,\" treats the relationship of action in the present to achieve an uncertain goal in the future. The determinism suggested by the dialectical materialism of Karl Marx is considered and criticized.Part III, Section 5, \"Ambiguity,\" returns to the originating theme of the work, that each individual is both radically free, able to transcend themself, and factical, constrained by that which just is what it is.  How does one remain true to one's freedom while allowing others their own freedom, even if they make mistakes?  Are we justified in telling the truth when another person finds the truth unbearable?  We have to act in particular situations, \"inventing an original solution\" each time, but remembering that \"man is man only through situations whose particularity is precisely a universal fact.\"The brief Conclusion sums up Beauvoir's view of human freedom: \"... we are absolutely free today if we choose to will our existence in its finiteness, a finiteness which is open on the infinite.\" She ends with a call for us to realize and act on this fundamental truth of our existence.\nPassage 6:\nSimone de Beauvoir Prize\nThe Simone de Beauvoir Prize (French: Prix Simone de Beauvoir pour la libert\u00e9 des femmes) is an international human rights prize for women's freedom, awarded since 2008 to individuals or groups fighting for gender equality and opposing breaches of human rights. It is named after the French author and philosopher Simone de Beauvoir, known for her 1949 women's rights treatise The Second Sex.The prize was founded by Julia Kristeva on 9 January 2008, the 100th anniversary of de Beauvoir's birth. \nSylvie Le Bon de Beauvoir and Pierre Bras are the head of the Simone de Beauvoir prize committee.According to the organizers:\n\nThe prize is awarded every year to a remarkable personality whose courage and thoughts are examples for everybody, in the spirit of Simone de Beauvoir who wrote: \"The ultimate end, for which human beings should aim, is liberty, the only capable [thing], to establish every end on.\"\n\nRecipients\n2008 \u2013 Taslima Nasreen, Bangladeshi writer, and Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Dutch feminist, writer and politician.\n2009 \u2013  One Million Signatures, a campaign by the Women's rights movement in Iran, demanding changes to discriminatory laws in Iran.\n2010 \u2013 Ai Xiaoming, Chinese videographer and professor at Sun Yat-sen University, and Jianmei Guo, Chinese lawyer and founder of the Women's Law Studies and Legal Aid Center at the Peking University School of Law.\n2011 \u2013 Lyudmila Ulitskaya, Russian novelist and civil rights activist\n2012 \u2013 Association tunisienne des femmes d\u00e9mocrates\n2013 \u2013 Malala Yousafzai,  Pakistani student, blogger and activist.\n2014 \u2013 Michelle Perrot, French historian \n2015 \u2013 National Museum of Women in the Arts\n2016 \u2013 Mayor of Lampedusa Guisi Nicolini for her involvement with the integration of immigrants on the island.\n2017 \u2013 Polish association 'Save Women'.

It consists of five short stories woven together in a way that is structurally similar to a more traditional novel.\nBeauvoir submitted this collection of interlinked stories to a publisher in 1937. But it was turned down by both Gallimard and Grasset. Gallimard eventually published it in 1979. The first English translation came out from Pantheon in 1982.The first story, \"Marcelle\", tells the story of the oldest of three siblings. She marries an abusive artist. The second, \"Chantal\", tells the story of a lycee philosophy teacher. She idealizes her life and becomes involved in the lives of her students but ultimately refuses to help them. \"Lisa\" is the third and shortest story, about a girl who struggles to live a spiritual life while existing in a physical body. \"Anne\", the fourth story, is the result of many of de Beauvoir's earlier attempts at writing. It parallels the story of her friend Elizabeth Mabille (Zaza) who died soon after her mother refused to allow her to marry Maurice Merleau-Ponty. The final story, \"Marguerite\" expresses the existential views that de Beauvoir herself believed that life itself should be experienced and one should \"look things straight in the face, without accepting oracles or ready-made values.\"\nPassage 8:\nBianca Lamblin\nBianca Lamblin (born Bienenfeld; 1921 \u2013 5 November 2011) was a French writer who had affairs with philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir for a number of years. In her book M\u00e9moires d'une jeune fille d\u00e9rang\u00e9e (published in English as A Disgraceful Affair), she wrote that, while a student at Lyc\u00e9e Moli\u00e8re, she was sexually exploited by her teacher Beauvoir, who was in her 30s. In correspondence between Sartre and Beauvoir, the pseudonym Louise V\u00e9drine was used when referring to Bianca in Lettres au Castor and Lettres \u00e0 Sartre.\n\nBiography\nBianca Lamblin was born in 1921 in Lublin, to Jewish parents. She was a cousin of the French writer Georges Perec. In 1937, her teacher was Simone de Beauvoir. She also met Sartre at this time. In Paris, Bianca was friends with Jean Kanapa, Yvonne Picard, Raoul L\u00e9vy and Bernard Lamblin. She married Bernard Lamblin and they had two children. Bianca became a teacher, and after Simone de Beauvoir's death, Bianca wrote M\u00e9moires d'une jeune fille d\u00e9rang\u00e9e.\n\nBibliography\nM\u00e9moires d'une jeune fille d\u00e9rang\u00e9e (1994, LGF - Livre de Poche; ISBN 978-2253135937/2006, Balland; ISBN 978-2-7158-0994-9)\n\nSee also\nOlga Kosakiewicz\nNatalie Sorokin\nPassage 9:\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Beauvoir\nHenriette-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Beauvoir (6 June 1910 \u2013 1 July 2001) was a French painter. She was the younger sister of philosopher Simone de Beauvoir. Her art was exhibited in Europe, Japan, and the US. She married Lionel de Roulet.When H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Beauvoir lived in Goxwiller, a village near Strasbourg, she became president of the center for battered women. She continued painting until she was 85. Her paintings were related to feminist philosophy and women's issues.\nPassage 10:\nNatalie Sorokin\nNatalie Sorokin (also Sorokine; 1921\u20131967) was a French woman who had relations with Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. Beauvoir was suspended from her teaching job after seducing her 17-year-old lyc\u00e9e pupil in 1939. Sorokin, along with Bianca Lamblin and Olga Kosakiewicz, later stated that their relationships with Sartre and de Beauvoir damaged them psychologically.\n\nExistential life with Simone de Beauvoir\nIn June 1943 Sorokin's mother complained to the school authorities that Beauvoir had led her daughter astray. Beauvoir was accused of behavior leading to the corruption of a minor and her teaching license was suspended for the rest of her life. Sorokin later said her relationship with Beauvoir and Sartre came to an end when she found this relationship serving only one party.\n\nLater life\nAfter recovering from her trauma, Sorokin started writing and worked for radio. She later married Ivan Moffat, a friend of Beauvoir and Sartre's and son of the British actress and poet Iris Tree and artist and photographer Curtis Moffat. Their marriage was brief and produced one daughter.\n\nSee also\nOlga Kosakiewicz\nBianca Lamblin", "answers": ["Les Temps modernes"], "incorrect_answer": "La Revue existentialiste"}, {"input": "Who created the term that the author of A Piece of Danish Happiness uses to explain why Danish people are the happiest in the world?", "context": "Passage 1:\nJesper Langballe\nJesper Marquard Langballe (31 August 1939 \u2013 15 March 2014) was a Danish Lutheran priest, author and politician who represented the right-wing populist Danish People's Party (Danish: Dansk Folkeparti) in the Danish parliament, Folketinget, from 2001 to 2011. Langballe was elected in the Viborg constituency. His son Christian Langballe was elected to the Folketinget in 2011.\n\nBiography\nLangballe was born in Copenhagen as the son of physician Mogens Marquard Langballe and housewife Agnete Langballe, n\u00e9e Wolfhagen. He is the cousin of S\u00f8ren Krarup, another MP for Dansk Folkeparti.\nHe was educated as a journalist at Skive Venstreblad 1959-61 and Ringk\u00f8bing Amts Dagblad 1962-63 and as a priest at the Ministry for Ecclesiastical Affairs institute 1972-75. He worked as a journalist at Jyllands-Posten 1964-72 as cultural reporter and back page editor doing political satire. Later he worked as a priest in Thorning-Grathe parish 1975\u20132007. He has since 1982 been a co-editor and writer at the fundamentalist Lutheran religious periodical Tidehverv.\n\nViews on church politics\nLangballe has been spokesman on church affairs for the Danish People's Party in the last few years and has positioned himself as a strong proponent for the privileged status of the Danish National Church (Danish: Folkekirken) and its close connection to the state, described in the Danish constitution.\nIn this context he has, for instance, stated as follows about the wishes of the Catholic church in Denmark to have its member contributions collected alongside state taxes, like the state Lutheran Church of Denmark:\n\nThe tax collection is a part of the state backing, and it shall not be provided for other religious communities. If you start doing this, then what about other private associations? In this context we are talking about an association with a religious purpose. But it might as well be a handball club.\n\nViews on Islam and muslims\nIn January 2010, Jesper Langballe defended controversial statements by Lars Hedegaard, chairman of Trykkefrihedsselskabet (the Free Press Society), in the Danish newspaper Berlingske Tidende stating that:\n\nOf course Lars Hedegaard should not have said that we see muslim fathers raping their daughters, when the reality rather seems to be that they simply kill them (the so called honor killings) \u2013 and besides that turn a blind eye to uncles raping them.\n\nThese controversial statements were later to be moderated by Langballe following pressure from party chairman Pia Kj\u00e6rsgaard, and he expressed his regrets about the phrasing - while he still supported the general message of the statement. During the general uproar following the statements, city council member in Viborg for the Danish People's Party, Rikke Cramer Christiansen, decided to leave the party in protest.\n\nFear of islamization and self-censorship\nIslam and islamization is seen by Jesper Langballe as an imminent threat to Denmark and Europe:\n\nIslam and Christianity cannot be reconciled. And they haven't been able to during the 1500 years that Islam has been in existence. I see the religion Islam as a threat to any society where it settles.\n\nAs a member of the Danish parliament I have eagerly contributed to integration work and I wish it all the best. But you shouldn't, trying to help integration, subject yourself to self-censorship and stop talking about real problems.\nIf islamization is allowed to go on unhindered in Denmark, there is definitely a risk that in a few years we are subjected to sharia. Of course there is.\n\nIn his original piece in Berlingske Tidende (mentioned above) Langballe explicitly referred to the book 1400-\u00e5rs krigen (The 1400 Year War), as well as referring to the book M\u00f8dom p\u00e5 mode (Fashionable Virginity) written by Danish author Kristina Aamand and her husband Asif Uddin.\n1400-\u00e5rs krigen is written by the above-mentioned Lars Hedegaard along with Langballe's party fellow Mogens Camre. The summary of the book says (in English):\n\nLars Hedegaard and Mogens Camre analyze, for the first time in Danish, the Islamic war theory, strategy and tactics in its full extent. Militarily, theologically, historically, psychologically.\nThe book shows how badly prepared the West is for the new jihad, a jihad far more sophisticated than earlier Islamic conquest attempts. If the EU and the West do not soon awake, it will ultimately mean the end of freedom.\nThe authors also show that even though Islam is a skillful and determined opponent, we still have the opportunity for action if we want to avoid the destiny that has fallen upon all other non-Muslim populations having come under the iron heel of Islam.\n\nAs opposed to Lars Hedegaard og Mogens Camre, Kristina Aamand has denounced Jesper Langballe's use of her book.\n\nSelected works (in Danish)\nContribution to the anthology Modstand og frihed (Resistance and Freedom), 1983.\nContribution to the anthology Og give dig fred.

The municipality covers an area of 250 square kilometres (97 sq mi), and has a population of 23,692 (1 January 2023). The municipality covers most of Stevns Peninsula.\nThe third largest town and the site of its municipal council is the town of H\u00e5rlev.\nOn 1 January 2007 Stevns municipality, as the result of Kommunalreformen (\"The Municipal Reform\" of 2007), merged with Vall\u00f8 municipality to form an enlarged Stevns municipality.\n\nLocations\nThe ten largest locations in the municipality are:\n\nThe town of Store Heddinge\nThe town of Store Heddinge came into existence during the 13th century, and Saint Katharina Church (Sct. Katharina kirke) is also from that time.  The town received privileged status as a merchant town in 1441.  A Latin preparatory school was founded in the town in 1620, but was closed down in 1739.\n\nPolitics\nMunicipal council\nStevns' municipal council consists of 19 members, elected every four years.\nBelow are the municipal councils elected since the Municipal Reform of 2007.\n\nAttractions\nThe area is known for its white chalk cliffs, which are quite rare in Denmark. Stevns Klint (Stevns' Cliffs), a popular tourist attraction, is one of these.  The old town church by the small village of H\u00f8jerup collapsed partially over the cliffs in 1928 due to erosion.\nThe cliffs at H\u00f8jerup are also the place where the father-and-son team of scientists Luis and Walter Alvarez measured the highest level of iridium in the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary layer, which led them to propose their hypothesis that the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event was caused by an impact of a large asteroid 66 million years ago.\nBy 2014 Stevns Klint was listed on UNESCO List of World Heritage Sites in Northern Europe.\nIn 2008 the Cold War Museum Stevns Fortress opened to the public. It features a large exhibition of military equipment and a 1.5-hour guided tour in the large underground system of the fortress. The underground system of the fortress features 1.6 kilometres (0.99 mi) of tunnels, living quarters, command centers, hospital and even a chapel. And in addition two ammunition depots for its two 15 centimetres (5.9 in) cannons. The tunnels are 18\u201320 metres (59\u201366 ft) below surface excavated in the chalk of Stevns. This top secret fortress was built in 1953 and remained operational until 2000.\nStevns is also home to Elverh\u00f8j (Elves' Hill), while not much of an attraction, it is famous for the fairy tale The Elf Mound by H.C.

Her writing infuses her personal story, and in 2012, she told her story to Oprah Winfrey during a televised Lifeclass in Toronto.\n\nPersonal life\nAlbrechtsen has received her undergraduate degree from Temple University and an MBA from Copenhagen Business School. She is married to Jesper Nielsen and lives in Charlottenlund, Denmark.\nPassage 6:\nMinister for Ecclesiastical Affairs (Denmark)\nMinister for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Denmark (Danish: kirkeminister, lit. Minister for the Church) is a Danish political minister office. The main responsibility of the minister is the Church of Denmark. The minister is politically appointed without any requirements being a member of the state church.The office was created in 1916 when the post Kultus Minister was split up into the posts of Education Minister and Minister for Ecclesiastical Affairs. The new Minister for Ecclesiastical Affairs also took over the responsibility for culture from the Kultus Minister. In 1961 responsibility for culture was transferred to the Minister for Cultural Affairs.\nSince 15 December 2022, Louise Schack Elholm from Venstre, holds the post in the Second Frederiksen Cabinet.\n\nSee also\nList of Ministers for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Denmark\nPassage 7:\nKenneth Kristensen Berth\nKenneth Kristensen Berth (born 3 February 1977 in Odense) is a Danish politician and author, who was a member of the Folketing for the Danish People's Party from 2015 to 2019.

Created by the Danish-Norwegian author Aksel Sandemose, it has also come to represent the egalitarian nature of Nordic countries.The \"Law\" was first formulated as ten rules in Sandemose's satirical novel A Fugitive Crosses His Tracks (En flyktning krysser sitt spor, 1933), but the attitudes themselves are older. Sandemose portrays the fictional small Danish town of Jante, modelled upon his native town Nyk\u00f8bing Mors in the 1930s where nobody was anonymous, a feature of life typical of small towns.\n\nDefinition\nThere are ten rules in the law as defined by Sandemose, all expressive of variations on a single theme and usually referred to as a homogeneous unit: You are not to think you're anyone special, or that you're better than us. \nThe ten rules state:\n\nYou're not to think you are anything special.\nYou're not to think you are as good as we are.\nYou're not to think you are smarter than we are.\nYou're not to imagine yourself better than we are.\nYou're not to think you know more than we do.\nYou're not to think you are more important than we are.\nYou're not to think you are good at anything.\nYou're not to laugh at us.\nYou're not to think anyone cares about you.\nYou're not to think you can teach us anything.The Janters who transgress this unwritten \"law\" are regarded with suspicion and some hostility, as it goes against the town's communal desire to preserve harmony, social stability and uniformity.\nAn eleventh rule recognized in the novel as \"the penal code of Jante\" is:\n\nPerhaps you don't think we know a few things about you?\nFrom the chapter \"Maybe you don't think I know something about you\":\n\nThat one sentence (the eleventh rule), which acts as the penal code of Jante, as such was rich in content. It was a charge of all sorts of things, and that it also had to be, because absolutely nothing was allowed. It was also an elaborate indictment, with all kinds of unspecified penalties given to be expected. Furthermore it was useful, depending fully on tone of voice, in financial extortion and enticement into criminal acts, and it could also be the best means of defense.\nSandemose's novel described working-class life in the fictional town of Jante. He wrote in 1955, a bit mischievously, that \"Many people have recognized [in Jante] their own hometown \u2013 this has happened regularly to people from Arendal [Norway], Troms\u00f8 [Norway] and Viborg [Denmark]\". Sandemose made no claim to having invented the rules; he simply sought to formulate social norms that had stamped the Danish and Norwegian psyches for centuries.\n\nSociological effects\nAlthough intended as criticism of society in general, some critics in the 1990s argued that the Law of Jante had shifted to refer to personal criticism of people who want to break out of their social groups and reach a higher position.It is common in Scandinavia to claim the Law of Jante as something quintessentially Danish, Norwegian or Swedish. The rules are treated as a way of behaving in order to fit in and results in dressing similarly and the types of cars that people buy and buying similar products for their homes. It is commonly stated that Jante Law is for people in the provinces, but commentators have suggested that metropolitan areas are also affected.While the original intention was as satire, Kim Orlin Kantardjiev, a Norwegian politician and educational advisor, claims that the Law of Jante is taught in schools as more of a social code to encourage group behavior, and wants to credit it with fueling Nordic countries' high happiness scores. It has also been suggested that contentedness with a humdrum lifestyle is a part of happiness in the Scandinavian countries.However, in Scandinavia, there have also been journalistic articles which link the Law of Jante to high suicide rates. Backlash has occurred against the rules, and in Norway someone even placed a grave for Jante Laws, declaring them dead in 2005. However, others have questioned whether they will ever go away, as they may be firmly entrenched in society.\n\nAppearance in English-language sources\nWhen interviewed during episode 646 of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, broadcast November 9, 2018, Swedish actor Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd explained that although he had recently received an Emmy and a Golden Globe Award for a lauded performance, the inhibitions induced by the Law of Jante prevented him from boasting of the accolade.\nIn Wisting, a 2019 Norwegian police procedural television series, partially in English, the character Line says (translated), \"The newspaper sales numbers and the Law of Jante are merging.\"\nIn Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown, Bourdain and Ren\u00e9 Redzepi discuss Janteloven's effect on Danish culture.\nIn some interviews, Greta Thunberg credits and appreciates the law for her being ignored by Swedes that see her in public.\n\nSee also\nPassage 10:\nList of Danish Nobel laureates\nThis is a list of Danish Nobel laureates.

It was the standard handgun of the US dragoons during the War of 1812.\n\nSpecifications\nThe Model 1805 horse pistol was copied from the French Pistolet Modele An. IX of 1798.  Harper's Ferry models 1805, 1806, 1807 and 1808 flintlock pistols were all identical and there were no changes in design during this model year sequence. The M1805 pistol was a .54 caliber, single-shot, smoothbore, flintlock pistol intended for field duty. Pistols made for officers resembled the standard horse pistol but featured more elaborate decoration, and sometimes a rifled barrel. Harper's Ferry model 1805\u20131808 flintlock pistols were known then as \u201chorsemen\u2019s pistols\u201d and were produced in pairs; both pistols having identical serial numbers. With just one shot readily available without reloading, a pair or \"brace\" was the standard issue. Horse accouterments also included a standard pair of saddle holsters. No serial number higher than 2048 has ever been discovered\u2014and that is exactly half of the number recorded as produced at the Harper's Ferry Armory. There are between 200\u2013300 of these pistols known to exist today.\n\nWar of 1812\nDuring the War of 1812, the M1805 pistol was issued to American cavalry. Due to the high demand for weapons, derivative pistols were manufactured in other states, especially Pennsylvania and Connecticut. Some featured improvements such as iron instead of wood ramrods. President Jackson favored the M1805 throughout his military career, and used a pair of these pistols in his famous duel with Charles Dickinson in 1806.\n\nLater developments\nImproved models of the Harpers Ferry pistol were produced in 1812, 1818, and 1835. These were the first standardised pistols issued to the US Marshals after the War of 1812, and to the Texas Rangers before the Texan War of Independence.A caplock conversion of the M1835 pistol was issued to the US Cavalry during the Seminole War and US-Mexican War until the Colt Dragoon revolver was introduced in 1847. The last Harpers Ferry pistol was the Model 1855, a .58 caliber handgun with a detachable shoulder stock designed for use by US dragoons during the Indian Wars.Harpers Ferry pistols were widely used by gunfighters and mountain men in the early days of the Old West, including Kit Carson. Many were also issued to the Confederate army during the American Civil War. Lawrence O'Bryan Branch was carrying a pair of M1835 pistols when he was killed by a Union army sniper in 1862.\n\nModern use\nCurrently manufactured reproductions of the original pistols are made with a larger caliber than the original, as well as a rifled bore for more accurate shooting. There is one reproduction available modeled after the percussion converted Harper's Ferry pistols that is built with the correct .54 caliber smooth bore as well. \n\nThe model 1805\u20131808 U.S. Marshal \"Harper's Ferry\" flintlock pistol is used today on the insignia of the U.S. Army Military Police Corps.\nPassage 2:\nSpreewerk\nMetallwarenfabrik Spreewerk GmbH was a German weapons manufacturing company. Spreewerk produced a number of important weapons and components before and during World War II including 280,880 of the Walther P.38 pistol which was the standard service pistol of the German Heer, and the famous 8.8 cm Flak anti-aircraft gun.\n\nHistory\nThe Berlin-Karlsruher Industrie Werke (BERKA) was founded in 1920 as a successor to the Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken AG, one of Germany's largest munitions firms of the prewar era. Under the regime of the Versailles treaty the firm was forced to give up the manufacture of armaments, which had been its core business. Most of the facilities that had grown up to meet the needs of war were reduced and BERKA carried on with factories in Berlin and Karlsruhe, manufacturing a variety of light metal goods.\nIn 1928 the firm passed under the control of G\u00fcnther Quandt who moved the company into the production of business machines, acquiring typewriter manufacturer Olympia Schreibmaschinen in 1929, and opening a new factory in 1933 at Erfurt to manufacture cash registers and other business machines. Under Herr Quandt's leadership further acquisitions followed.\nIn 1938 the firm re-entered the field of munitions production, establishing Metallwarenfabrik Spreewerk to undertake the fabrication of munitions components at the former Berlin-Spandau factory of the defunct Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken. This was followed in 1939 by the establishment of a modern ammunition loading facility on a forty hectare site near the city of L\u00fcbeck by the newly established Maschinen f\u00fcr Massenverpackung GmbH. Early in 1940 the firm strengthened its role in the manufacture of industrial machinery through the acquisition of the Berlin-Anhaltische Maschinenbau of Dessau.\nThe factories of the firm include:\n\nBerlin-Karlsruher Industrie Werke AG, Berlin-Borsigwalde (metal fabrication)\nBerlin-Karlsruher Industrie Werke AG, Karlsruhe-Durlach (metal fabrication)Subsidiaries of the firm include:\n\nBerlin-Anhaltische Maschinenbau AG, Dessau (machine building)\nMaschinen f\u00fcr Massenverpackung GmbH, L\u00fcbeck-Schlutup (munitions)\nMetallwarenfabrik Spreewerk AG, Berlin-Spandau (munitions)\nOlympia B\u00fcromaschinenwerke AG, Erfurt (business and tabulating machines)\nOlympia Schreibmaschinen AG, Berlin-Spandau (typewriters and business machines)\nS\u00e4chsische Maschinenfabrik AG, Chemnitz (machine building)Spreewerk was formed in September 1935 in Spandau Germany as a subsidiary of Deutschen Industrie-Werke A.G. (DIWAG). Spreewerk was involved in weapons production from its formation until April 1945 at the Spandau complex; and from June 1942 to April 1945 at the Grottau, Czechoslovakia factory named Werk Grottau.\n\nProducts\nWWII era weapons produced by Spreewerk include:\n\nSpandau, Germany\ns 10 cm K 18\n15 cm sFH 18\n8.8 cm Flak\nGrottau, Czechoslovakia\nP.38 Pistol\nVG 2 Rifle\n\nMarkings\n\nThe Waffenamt inspector at Spreewerk Grottau was assigned code WaA88.

The barrel is attached to the frame by a hinge, allowing for very easy disassembly. Certain aspects of the pistol are covered by Czechoslovakian patent 65558 which may also be found as Finnish patent FI18533(A) from 1939.\nThe pistol was never used by the Czechoslovak military, as the vz. 38 orders were not yet delivered when Germany occupied Czechoslovakia in 1938. Several vz. 38s, modified to have a manual safety, were exported to Bulgaria before the German occupation. Most of the pistols saw service in Greater German police and security forces, and despite several issues the vz. 38 was still in production until 1945. Some were captured used by Yugoslav partisans.\n\nSee also\nWeapons of Czechoslovakia interwar period\n\nUsers\nBulgaria\n Finland - 1,700 pistols bought from Germany in 1940.\n Nazi Germany\n Yugoslavia\nPassage 5:\nWalther P38\nThe Walther P38 (originally written Walther P.38) is a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol that was developed by Carl Walther GmbH as the service pistol of the Wehrmacht at the beginning of World War II. It was intended to replace the comparatively complex and expensive to produce Luger P08. Moving the production lines to the easier mass producible P38 once World War II started took longer than expected, leading to the P08 remaining in production until September 1942, and pre-existing copies remained in service until the end of the war.\n\nDevelopment\nAs the Luger P08 was expensive to produce, Germany started to look for a replacement as early as 1927, settling on the Walther P38 in 1938, which offered similar performance to the Luger P08, but took almost half the time to produce.The first design was submitted to the German Army and featured a locked breech and a hidden hammer, but the Army requested that it should be redesigned with an external hammer.\nThe P38 concept was accepted by the German military in 1938 but production of prototype (\"Test\") pistols did not begin until late 1939. Walther began manufacture at their plant in Zella-Mehlis and produced three series of \"Test\" pistols, designated by a \"0\" prefix to the serial number. The third series pistols satisfactorily solved the previous problems for the German Army and mass production began in mid-1940, using Walther's military production identification code \"480\".Several experimental versions were later created in .45 ACP, and .38 Super, but these were never mass-produced. In addition to the  9\u00d719mm Parabellum version, some 7.65\u00d721mm Parabellum and some .22 Long Rifle versions were also manufactured and sold.\n\nDesign details\nThe P.38 was a cutting edge semi-automatic pistol design, which introduced technical features still used today in current commercial and military semi-automatic pistols, including the Beretta 92FS and its M9 sub-variant adopted by the United States military in 1985.\nThe P38 was the first locked-breech pistol to use a double-action/single-action (DA/SA) trigger (the earlier double-action PPK was an unlocked blowback design, but the more powerful 9\u00d719mm Parabellum round used in the P38 mandated a locked breech design). The shooter could chamber a round, use the safety-decocking lever to safely lower the hammer without firing the round, and carry the weapon with a round chambered.  The lever can stay on \"safe\", or if returned to \"fire\", the weapon remains safely \"ready\" with a long, double-action trigger pull for the first shot. Pulling the trigger cocks the hammer before firing the first shot with double-action operation. The firing mechanism extracts and ejects the first spent round, cocks the hammer, and chambers a fresh round for single-action operation with each subsequent shot \u2013 all features found in many modern day handguns. Besides a DA/SA trigger design similar to that of the earlier Walther PPKs the P38 features a visible and tactile loaded chamber indicator in the form of a metal rod that protrudes from the rear of the slide when a round is chambered.\nThe moving-barrel mechanism is actuated by a wedge-shaped hinged locking piece underneath the breech. When the pistol is fired, the barrel and slide recoil together, until the hinged locking piece drives down, disengaging the slide and arresting further rearward movement of the barrel. The slide continues its rearward movement on the frame, ejecting the spent case and cocking the hammer before reaching the end of travel. Unlike most autopistols which eject empty cases to the right, the Walther P38 ejects empty cases to the left. Two recoil springs on either side of the frame and below the slide, having been compressed by the slide's rearward movement, drive the slide forward, stripping a new round from the magazine, driving it into the breech and re-engaging the barrel; ending its return travel with a fresh round chambered, hammer cocked and ready to repeat the process.\nThe hinged locking piece assisted breechblock design provides good accuracy due to the in-line travel of the barrel and slide.\nInitial production P38 pistols were fitted with walnut grips, but these were later supplanted by Bakelite grips.\nSheet metal grips were used for a time on pistols produced in France after the war, being called \"Gray Ghosts\" by collectors on the account of their distinctive parkerizing and sheet metal grips. Post war P1 grips were made of black colored plastic.\n\nVariants\nThe Walther P.38 was in production from 1939 to 1945. Initial development of the pistol took place 1937-1939, culminating in the first model, designated Model HP or Heerespistole (\"army pistol\"), which had several variants as engineering changes were made. Early production included a Swedish contract.  The designation P.38 indicates Wehrmacht adoption in 1938, although the exact date is unknown.  The transition from HP to the mechanically-identical P.38-marked pistols took place 1939-1940. Sweden bought the P38 in 1939.During WWII, the P.38 was produced by three separate manufacturers: Walther, Mauser, and Spreewerk.  To conceal manufacturer identities, each wartime manufacturer used a letter code: ac (Walther); byf (Mauser), and cyq (Spreewerk), followed by the date (e.g.: ac44: Walther 1944 production).  Spreewerk did not mark production dates. Pistols were produced in blocks of 10,000 consecutively numbered pistols, with each block having a consecutive letter suffix, to conceal production volume.  1,277,680 P.38s were produced during WWII: 617,585 by Walther in Zella-Mehlis; 372,875 by Mauser in Oberndorf; 287,220 by Spreewerk Grottau. Late in the war, the Spreewerk cyq die broke.  Subsequent pistols appear to be marked \"cvq\" due to the broken die.  About 31,400 pistols are so marked. Spreewerk production ended April 1945.After the war from 1945-1946, several thousands of pistols were assembled for the French armed forces(frequently dubbed \"grey ghosts\" because of parkerized finish and grey sheet metal grips). Only after 1957 was the P38 again produced for the German military.  Slowly over time, West Germany desired to rebuild its military so that it could shoulder some of the burden for its own defense.  Walther retooled for new P38 production since no military firearms production had occurred in West Germany since the end of the war, knowing that the military would again seek Walther firearms.  When the Bundeswehr announced it wanted the P38 for its official service pistol, Walther readily resumed P38 production within just two years, using wartime pistols as models and new engineering drawings and machine tools.  The first of the new P38s were delivered to the West German military in June 1957, some 17 years and two months after the pistol had initially seen action in World War II, and from 1957 to 1963 the P38 was again the standard sidearm.\n\nP1\nIn late 1963 the postwar military model P1 was adopted for use by the German military, identifiable by the P1 stamping on the slide. The postwar pistols, whether marked as P38 or P1, have an aluminium frame rather than the steel frame of the original design. Starting in June 1975, the aluminum frame was reinforced with a hex bolt above the trigger guard, and a slightly modified, stronger slide design was introduced.\nDuring the 1990s the German military started replacing the P1 with the P8 pistol and finally phased out the P1 in 2004.\n\nP4\nAn improved version of the P38, the Walther P4, was developed in the late 1970s and was adopted by the police forces of South Africa, Rhineland-Palatinate and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\n\nUsers\nAfghanistan: Afghan National Police received 10,000 P1s after the fall of the Taliban\n Algeria\n Austria\n Bulgaria:Supplied by Germany during WW2\n Canada: Used by the prisoner transport services of the Correctional Service Canada until the late 1980s.

It has a polymer frame with internal strengthening ribs. The 9\u00d719mm version holds 9+1 rounds and uses a single stack magazine. The barrel length is 3+3\u20448 inches. The gun features a safety, a magazine hold open, and a decocker (operated by pushing the safety up beyond the \"safe\" function).\nThe design is somewhat similar to the Browning Hi-Power or the CZ 75. The pistol weighs approximately 696 grams (1.5 lbs) empty (no magazine) and 870 grams (1.9 lbs) with a full magazine. It is known as a reliable, durable sidearm. Although surpassed by more modern double stack compact pistols, the Ultra Star was once a popular choice for concealed carry. Magazines are still available, though tending to be a bit pricey. Other brand magazines have successfully been modified to fit in this pistol.\nPassage 7:\nSteyr TMP\nThe Steyr TMP (Taktische Maschinenpistole/Tactical Machine Pistol) is a 9\u00d719mm Parabellum caliber machine pistol manufactured by Steyr Mannlicher of Austria. The magazines come in 15 or 30 round detachable box types. A suppressor can also be fitted. Though originally intended to be used without a shoulder stock, an optional fixed stock was made available later. \nIn 2001, Steyr sold the design to Br\u00fcgger & Thomet, who developed it into the Br\u00fcgger & Thomet MP9.\n\nSPP\nThe Steyr SPP (Special Purpose Pistol) is a semi-automatic variant of the TMP. The TMP's barrel and barrel jacket lengths were increased slightly so there is a greater length of protruding jacket and barrel. The forward tactical pistol grip was also removed. It is large for a pistol and is constructed mainly from Polyamide 66.\n\nUsers\nAustria: Used by EKO Cobra.\n Italy: Used by the Gruppo di Intervento Speciale.\n Myanmar : Manufactured locally as MA-13 MK-II.\n\nSee also\nBeretta 93R\nBr\u00fcgger & Thomet MP9\nHeckler & Koch VP70\nKGP-9\nBXP\nPatria\nPP-2000\nPassage 8:\nHeckler &amp; Koch VP70\nThe VP70 is a 9\u00d719mm, 18-round, double action only, semi-automatic/three-round burst capable polymer frame pistol manufactured by German arms firm Heckler & Koch GmbH. VP stands for Volkspistole (literally \"People's Pistol\"), and the designation 70 was for the first year of production, 1970.\n\nDesign\nThe VP70 combined a number of design features that were innovative, or at least very unusual for its time:\n\nIt was the first polymer-framed handgun, predating the Glock 17 by 12 years. At 820 g (28.9 oz) unloaded, the weapon is lighter than most metal framed pistols of the time.\nIt has a double-stack, double-feed magazine; double-feed magazines are uncommon for pistols even today. These magazines hold 18 rounds, a rather high capacity for its original production time.\nAs on the Mauser C96 and the Lahti L35, the stock was designed to be used as a holster when not mounted. On the military version of the VP70 this combination includes a unique feature: when mounted, a selective-fire switch, located on the stock, allows switching the weapon to a three-round-burst mode, with a 2,200 rounds per minute cyclic rate of fire.\nThe VP70 uses a spring-loaded striker like a Glock, instead of a conventional hammer.\nIt is double-action only, so the trigger pull is relatively heavy.\nIn lieu of a blade front sight, the VP70 uses a polished ramp with a central notch in the middle to provide the illusion of a dark front post.\nThe barrel has very deeply cut rifling; this was done to purposely vent gas past the bullet, placing less gas pressure on the slide, a critical part of the VP70's direct blowback function. This also results in slightly reduced bullet velocity when compared to other pistols with similar, or even slightly shorter barrel length.\n\nVariants\nThe handgun comes in two varieties. The \"M\" (Milit\u00e4r, military) variant is selective-fire (semi-auto/three-round bursts), the \"Z\" (Zivil, civilian) variant is a semi-automatic-only version. The VP70Z has no provision to attach the stock, and also lacks the internal mechanical parts required for the burst-fire function even if the stock was attached. The VP70Z also has a crossbolt safety right behind the trigger; on the VP70M this is replaced with a non-functional plug, relying only on the heavy double-action trigger for safety.\nFour hundred VP70Zs were made in 9\u00d721mm IMI; these samples were made primarily for the civilian market of Italy, where the use of the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum was at the time permitted only to military and law enforcement agencies. All of the VP70Z pistols sold to Italy had the provision to mount the stock, but still lacked the three-round-burst firing capability.\n\nUsers\nBrazil:Used by 1\u00ba Batalh\u00e3o de For\u00e7as Especiais\n Lebanon: Used during the Lebanese Civil War; adopted by some police forces\n Morocco\n Paraguay: VP70Z variant.\n Portugal: VP70M variant.\nPassage 9:\nMitchell Alpha .45\nThe Mitchell Alpha .45 is a pistol manufactured by the American Mitchell Arms company. It is .45 ACP in calibre and its magazine size is 8 rounds. The Alpha uses the Browning-type locking mechanism and weighs 39 ounces. There is no trigger stop on the pistol and its sights are fixed. Its external safety is compatible to the ambidextrous shooter, with an ambidextrous safety catch.\nPassage 10:\nStar Model S\nThe Star Model S was a Spanish semi-automatic pistol manufactured by Star Bonifacio Echeverria, S.A. and designed to use the .380 ACP cartridge.  Like many semi-automatic handguns, the basic design of the Star Model S is based on the .45 calibre Colt 1911.  But it is much smaller, lighter, and lacks some of the safety features of the Colt pistol. It is this lightness and lack of safety features that make this a fast gun.\nAt one time the Star Model S was the official sidearm of the Spanish Foreign Legion.  The Star Model S was imported into the United States by the Interarms company of Alexandria, Virginia.  Interarms went out of business in early 1990s at about the same time the Star company went out of business.  The Star Model S is no longer manufactured.\n\nSee also\nList of firearms", "answers": ["Luger P08"], "incorrect_answer": "Colt M1911"}, {"input": "Electoral district of Bragg currently includes which suburb in the city of Burnside, Adelaide?", "context": "Passage 1:\nElectoral district of Bragg\nBragg is a single-member electoral district for the South Australian House of Assembly. The seat is named after the eminent physicists Bragg \u2013 William Henry and his son, William Lawrence. The electorate is largely suburban and encompasses a significant portion of the City of Burnside, stretching from the east parklands of Adelaide into the Adelaide Hills. After the redistribution following the 2006 election, the boundary moved eastwards to include suburbs that had formerly been in the electorate of Heysen and now borders Kavel. Bragg currently includes the metropolitan suburbs of Beaumont, Burnside, Cleland, Dulwich, Eastwood, Erindale, Frewville, Glenside, Glenunga, Greenhill, Hazelwood Park, Heathpool, Horsnell Gully, Leabrook, Leawood Gardens, Linden Park, Marryatville, Mount Osmond, Rose Park, Rosslyn Park, Skye, St Georges, Stonyfell, Toorak Gardens, Tusmore, Waterfall Gully, Wattle Park and part of Glen Osmond. (Previous suburbs prior to redistribution included Auldana, Beulah Park, Kensington, Kensington Park, and Kensington Gardens.)\nThe electorate was first contested at the 1970 election as a replacement for the abolished, larger electorate of Burnside, one of fifteen new electorates created in Adelaide to give the metropolitan area fairer representation. It has been held by the Liberals and their predecessors, the Liberal and Country League for its entire existence, and for most of that time has been the safest Liberal seat in the metropolitan area. The Liberals have always won outright majorities on the first count, and until 2022 never won less than 60 percent of the two-party vote.\nAs a measure of the strong Liberal support in this seat, the Liberals easily retained it even in the Labor landslides of 1977, 1985 and 2006, each time winning at least 55 percent of the primary vote. For example, in 2006 the Liberals suffered a swing of 6.8 percent in Bragg, but still comfortably retained it with a majority of 12.6 percent\u2013the only safe metropolitan Liberal seat and one of only four safe Liberal seats statewide.\nThe seat has been held by only three members in its present incarnation, all of whom have gone on to serve in cabinet. Bragg's best-known member was its first, David Tonkin, who served as Premier of South Australia from 1979 to 1982. He resigned shortly after the Liberals lost the 1982 state election.  At the ensuing 1983 Bragg by-election fellow Liberal Graham Ingerson retained the seat without serious difficulty. Ingerson went on to become a minister under Dean Brown and John Olsen and served as Deputy Premier under Olsen from 1996 to 1998. Ingerson retired in 2002 and was succeeded by incumbent Vickie Chapman, two time Liberal leadership challenger and two time Liberal deputy leader from 2006 until 2009 and again since 2013. In 2018 Chapman became Deputy Premier.\nIn 2022, however, the Liberal margin dropped to 58 percent, making it only fairly safe for the first time. It is still the largest Liberal margin for a metropolitan seat.\nOn 19 April 2022, Chapman announced her intention to resign from politics and parliament, forcing a by-election, which was held on 2 July 2022.\n\nMembers for Bragg\nElection results\nNotes\nPassage 2:\nMoratuwa Electoral District\nMoratuwa electoral district was an electoral district of Sri Lanka between August 1947 and February 1989.

The suburb is adjacent to Adelaide's east parklands, and forms part of the western boundary of the City of Burnside. Dulwich is a mix of residential housing and commercial activity\u2013corporate offices and businesses line Fullarton and Greenhill Roads. The suburb is bordered by Rose Park to the north, Toorak Gardens to the east, Glenside to the south and the Adelaide Parklands to the west.\nThe area, which was settled by Europeans in the 19th century and used as pasture, made a slow transition to a residential suburb which was complete by the mid 20th century. Much of the area's 19th century housing stock has been recognised with heritage protection. Dulwich's close location to the Adelaide city centre, grand old houses and leafy tree-lined streets make it an attractive and sought-after suburb.\n\nHistory\nPrior to European settlement, the general area was inhabited by the Kaurna tribe of Indigenous Australians.Dulwich, named after the settlement in the London Borough of Southwark, has its origins in Section 263 of the Adelaide region as laid out by South Australia's first chief surveyor, Colonel William Light. It was bought by a Captain of the Royal Navy, Daniel Pring. In his initial absence the section was leased to a local cattle dealer, but upon the early death of Pring, his wife inherited the area. After several transactions the land was sold; John Hector, manager of the Savings Bank of South Australia bought much of the land with the exception of that located around Victoria Park. It was Hector who christened the land as the 'Village of Dulwich', or in the colloquial terms of the time, 'Hector's Paddock'. Hector oversaw the subdivision of the land and its transfer to many new owners. The Adelaide press at the time, in the form of the Advertiser and the South Australian Gazetter, was exceptionally generous in their words relating to the new village: 'The Suburban Village of Dulwich ... beautifully situated on a gentle rise sufficient to command a view of the sea, with the noble amphitheatre of the hills for a background', 'For building sites convenient to the metropolis, Dulwich has no rival'.\n\nWhile Dulwich in 1881 was only home to four residences, by 1891, after a period of explosive growth, there were 50. Businesses began to establish themselves in Dulwich during the early part of the 20th century. By the 1930s, Dulwich was home to manufacturers, blacksmiths, engineers and other groups. This business establishment experienced a surge in the latter part of the 20th century, and offices and businesses now completely line the two major road borders (Greenhill and Fullarton Roads), attracted there by the close proximity to the Adelaide city centre and the lush surroundings.\nWith many sons of the suburb fighting in World War II, a Returned Services League was founded with their return. Eventually the league building became that of the Dulwich Retired Citizens Club, and with its purchase by the Burnside Council, it has become the Dulwich Community Centre. Between 1955 and 1958, a young Tony Blair (British Prime Minister 1997\u20132007) lived with his family in a house on Ormond Grove while his father Leo was a Law lecturer at the University of Adelaide. One of the first Kentucky Fried Chicken stores in the country was established in Dulwich in the 1980s, however by 2000 it had moved to nearby Eastwood.\n\nAttractions\nDulwich Community Centre\nSt. Patrick's Special School\nDulwich Centre (aka Dulwich Village)\n\nResidents\nAccording to the 2001 Census, the population of the Dulwich census area (which includes adjoining Rose Park) is 2,663 people, with a very slight decrease in population between the 1996 and 2001 censuses. 52.4% of the population is female, 79.4% are Australian born (see chart for a breakdown of foreign-born) and 92.5% of residents are Australian citizens. Religious adherence in Dulwich is lower than the Burnside and Adelaide average, standing at 64.3%. The eight strongest religions in decreasing order are; Catholic, Anglican, Uniting Church, Orthodox, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Buddhism and Hinduism. The most common type of dwelling was a Separate House (64.4%) followed by a flat, apartment or other (24.9%) and a semi-detached house (9.6%). Dulwich has a highly educated population with 44.5% holding a diploma or higher degree. This educational attainment is reflected in household income - almost two-thirds earn over A$1000 per week.\nSimilar to other inner-city suburbs, Dulwich has a large proportion of students who attend nearby universities (9.2%). Overseas students are a sizeable component of this population and represent some of the 7.5% of residents who are not Australian citizens. 60% of households represent families with children; the remaining households are divided among couples without children, lone person households and other non-traditional groupings.[1]\n\nTransport\nCars are the dominant means of transport to work in Dulwich; 70% of the population are either a driver or passenger in a vehicle. 10% walked, cycled or caught public transport. Public transport usage is notably higher than the City of Burnside and Adelaide average, owing to the suburb's close inner-city location. A number of bus routes serve the suburb: the 144 travels to Glen Osmond through Dulwich, as does the 147 to Beaumont; the 580 route travels from Mile End to Paradise Interchange along Portrush Road; the 820 Hills bus travels along Greenhill Road to Carey Gully. 10% of the population owns no vehicles, 40% owns one, 35% owns two and the remainder own three or more. One early problem with Adelaide's streets built in a grid layout was the tendency for motorists to use inner suburb local roads instead of main roads. 'Rat trails' of cars sneaked through narrow sidestreets, creating sizeable bottlenecks. This was a particular problem for Dulwich because of its location - various traffic control methods were put in place (closing streets, speed bumps, lowered speed limits, roundabouts) to counter these problems. This forced the re-routing of traffic onto local thoroughfares such as Fullarton, Greenhill, Kensington and Portrush Roads.[2]\n\nGovernment\nDulwich is part of the state Electoral District of Bragg, which has been held since 2002 by Liberal MP Vickie Chapman. In federal politics, the suburb is part of the Division of Adelaide, and has been represented by Labor MP Kate Ellis since 2004. The results shown are from the closest polling station to Dulwich \u2013 which is located outside of the suburb \u2013 at Rose Park Primary School in nearby Rose Park.\nDulwich is a socially moderate and economically liberal suburb. The center-right Liberal Party polls very well in the area with around 60% of the vote in the 2007 and 2010 federal elections . The area previously had a relatively strong Democrat vote, until very poor results in the Federal Election of 2004 and the State Election of 2006. The Labor Party and the Greens have absorbed much of the former Democrat vote.\nAt the council level, Dulwich is part of the Rose Park & Toorak Gardens Ward of the City of Burnside.\nPassage 4:\nBatticaloa Electoral District (1947\u20131989)\nBatticaloa Electoral District was an electoral district of Sri Lanka between August 1947 and February 1989.

The film stars Ethel Clayton, Clyde Fillmore, Jean Acker, Irving Cummings, Charles Meredith, and Ruth Ashby. The film was released on July 11, 1920, by Paramount Pictures.\n\nPlot\nEdith Parrish is a magazine illustrator whose publisher friend, Peter Gordon, has married an \"unworthy wife\", Dora Leroy. To keep her friend from being shattered by his wife's infidelity with Ralph Brent, Edith begins a series of lies to coverup the affair. However, this leads to suspicion that she is having a romance with Brent, which causes her true love, John Blaine to doubt her. Brent, who respects Edith, comes clean to Blaine about the situation, and Edith and him are reconciled.\nSources:\n\nCast\nEthel Clayton as Edith Parrish\nClyde Fillmore as Peter Gordon\nJean Acker as Dora Leroy\nIrving Cummings as Ralph Brent\nCharles Meredith as John Blaine\nRuth Ashby as Maid\nPassage 6:\nJean Acker\nJean Acker (born Harriet Ackers; October 23, 1892 \u2013 August 16, 1978) was an American actress with a career dating from the silent film era through the 1950s. She was perhaps best known as the estranged wife of silent film star Rudolph Valentino.\n\nEarly life and career\nJean Acker was born Harriet Ackers on October 23, 1892 in Trenton, New Jersey to Joseph and Margaret Ackers. The 1900 census indicates an 1891 birthdate, and other sources have suggested an 1893 birthdate. However, her burial plot says 1892. Her parents divorced, and her father remarried to Eleanor Bruseren in 1906. They had two sons together, both named Joseph. Their first son died at 4 months old in 1907, and their second son was a stillbirth. Eleanor and Joseph divorced in 1912, and he remarried a third time to Virginia Erb. Her father managed the Casino Bowling Alley and The Ritz Restaurant, and later owned the Boston Shoe Store on Valley Street. He also managed several bowling alleys in the Philadelphia area. In 1906, the family moved to Lewistown. Growing up on a farm, Ackers became an expert horsewoman. She attended St. Mary's Seminary in Springfield, New Jersey for a time. \nShe performed in vaudeville until she moved to California in 1919. After arriving in Hollywood, Acker became the protegee and lover of Alla Nazimova, an actress whose clout and contacts enabled Acker to negotiate a $200 per week contract with a movie studio. Acker appeared in numerous films during the 1910s and 1920s, but by the early 1930s, she began appearing in small, mostly uncredited film roles. She made her last on-screen appearance in the 1955 film How to Be Very, Very Popular, opposite Betty Grable.\n\nMarriage to Valentino\nAfter meeting and befriending the then-struggling actor Rudolph Valentino at a party, they entered a two-month courtship and married on November 6, 1919. Acker quickly had regrets and locked him out of their hotel bedroom on their wedding night. The marriage was reportedly never consummated.After filing for divorce, Valentino did not wait the requisite period for it to be finalized before marrying his second wife, Natacha Rambova, in Mexico, and he was charged with bigamy when the couple returned to the United States. Acker then sued Valentino for the legal right to call herself Mrs. Rudolph Valentino. Valentino remained angry with her for several years, but they mended their friendship before his death in 1926. Acker wrote a popular song about him soon after he died called \"We Will Meet at the End of the Trail\".Acker had an affair with the actress Alla Nazimova. Nazimova included Acker in what was dubbed the sewing circles, a group of actresses who were forced to conceal the fact that they were lesbian or bisexual, thus living secret lives. Another of her female lovers was Grace Darmond, with whom she was involved during her relationship with Valentino.\nIn the 1977 film Valentino a character loosely based on Acker is played by Carol Kane. In the credits, the character is simply called Starlet.\n\nLater life and death\nAfter divorcing Valentino in 1923, Acker was engaged to Marquis Luis de Bezan y Sandoval of Spain. Then, she was in the news over her relationship with Rahmin Bey. In 1930, after she lost her fortune in the 1929 stock market crash, she sued William Delahanty, claiming that he agreed to pay her $18,400 per year if she gave up her film career. The married politician denied that he made such a promise but admitted that he spent thousands of dollars on Acker. Acker met Chloe Carter (June 21, 1903 \u2013 October 28, 1993), a former Ziegfeld Follies girl, who was the first wife of film composer Harry Ruby. Acker remained with Carter for the rest of her life. The couple owned an apartment building together in Beverly Hills. Acker died of natural causes in 1978 at the age of 85, and is buried next to Carter at the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.\n\nLegacy\nAlthough not born in the Central Pennsylvania town of Lewistown, Jean Acker is considered a local celebrity. Her face dominates an outdoor mural titled \"Mifflin County Movie History\" and is located on Monument Square in Downtown Lewistown. The mural was painted in 2012 by Dwight Kirkland of Blackleaf Studio, Mifflintown, Pennsylvania.\n\nFilmography\nPassage 7:\nJackie Long\nJackie Long (born October 23, 1981) is an American television and film actor, writer, musician, director and producer.

He served in the Illinois Senate and was a member of the United States House of Representatives.\n\nBiography\nNoonan was born in Macomb, Illinois on October 23, 1861, and raised in Quincy and Chicago. He was educated in Quincy and Chicago, and studied law with Chicago attorney and judge Van H. Higgins. He attended law school at the University of Michigan while studying with Higgins, attained admission to the bar in 1882, and received his LL.B. degree in 1883.In addition to practicing law, Noonan was active in Chicago politics as a Democrat.  From 1890 to 1894, he was a member of the Illinois Senate, and from 1893 to 1897 he served on the military staff of Governor John Peter Altgeld with the rank of colonel.  Noonan was counsel for the West Chicago Park Commission from 1893 to 1898, and as an unsuccessful candidate for Congress in 1894 and 1896.Noonan was elected to the U.S. House in 1898, and served in the 56th United States Congress (March 4, 1899 \u2013 March 3, 1901). Noonan was not a candidate for reelection in 1900 and resumed the practice of law in Chicago.\n\nDeath and burial\nNoonan died in Chicago on December 19, 1923. He was buried at St. Paul's Catholic Cemetery in Macomb.\n\nFamily\nNoonan and his wife Lillian were the parents of two sons, Laurence (b. 1907) and Cato (b. 1916).\nPassage 9:\nWilson Wood (actor)\nWilson Wood (born Charles Woodrow Tolkien, February 11, 1915 \u2013 October 23, 2004) was an American character actor during the middle of the twentieth century.\nBorn in Huron, North Dakota on February 11, 1915, he made his film debut with a small role in 1946's Two Sisters from Boston, directed by Henry Koster. During his 17-year career he would appear in over 100 films, usually in smaller roles. In 1952 he would star in a serial for Republic Pictures.  The 12 part series was titled, Zombies of the Stratosphere, which would be edited down and released in 1958 as a feature film, called Satan's Satellites. His final appearance would be in the 1962 film, Jumbo, starring Doris Day, Stephen Boyd and Jimmy Durante, in which Wood had a featured role. Wood died on October 23, 2004, in Culver City, California.\n\nFilmography\n(Per AFI database)", "answers": ["Jean Acker"], "incorrect_answer": "Irving Cummings"}, {"input": "The debut album came out in 1988 but what year did the song \"She's My Baby\" come out in?", "context": "Passage 1:\nGo to the Top (album)\nGo to the Top is the debut album by Japanese singer-songwriter Hitomi, released on September 27, 1995, by Avex Trax. The first press edition of the album came with the CD case housed inside a hardback case, similar to a book. The inside of the back of the case contains a mini-photobook. The RIAJ has certified it 2\u00d7 platinum, recognizing over 500,000+ shipments throughout Japan.  On the Oricon charts, the album's peak position was #3, and it stayed on the charts for eight weeks.\n\nHistory\nHitomi had previously released two singles without much success. Her debut single, \"Let's Play Winter\" failed to chart on Japan's Oricon chart, and her follow-up single, \"We Are \"Lonely Girl\"\", while charting much better at #61 on the charts, failed to make a big impression with sales.\nIt was not until the quiet release of her third single \"Candy Girl\" that suddenly Hitomi found success. \"Candy Girl\" charted much higher than her previous attempts, becoming her first single to chart in the Oricon top 20. This was most likely because \"Candy Girl\" had been aggressively marketed and appeared in a famous Japanese Kodak commercial. The single established the then 19-year-old Hitomi Furuya into a household name, showcasing her provocative image.\nFollowing the sudden success of her third single, Hitomi and her label (fledgling at the time) Avex Trax quickly released another single, \"Go to the Top\" which also charted in the top 20, ensuring Hitomi's success for the time being.

It was released on October 29, 1990, as the follow-up to their 1988 debut, Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1. The band members again adopted pseudonyms for their contributions, using new names from the fictitious Wilbury brothers.\n\nHistory\nThough it was their second release, the album was mischievously titled Vol. 3 by George Harrison.  According to Jeff Lynne, \"That was George's idea.  He said, 'Let's confuse the buggers.'\"As the dynamics within the band had shifted with Roy Orbison's death, the four remaining members all adopted new Wilbury pseudonyms: Spike (George Harrison), Clayton (Jeff Lynne), Muddy (Tom Petty) and Boo (Bob Dylan). With Harrison and Lynne producing again, the sessions were undertaken in the spring of 1990. An additional track, a cover of \"Nobody's Child\", was recorded and released in June 1990 as a charity single in aid of Olivia Harrison's Romanian Angel Appeal. The song was also the title track of a multi-artist fundraising album compiled by the Harrisons, Nobody's Child: Romanian Angel Appeal. Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3 was dedicated to the memory of \"Lefty Wilbury\" (Roy Orbison).\nReleased in October 1990, the album was less positively received than Vol. 1, yet still saw a fair measure of success. In the United States, \"She's My Baby\" (with guest guitarist Gary Moore) and \"Inside Out\" became radio hits, charting at number 2 album rock and number 16 album rock, respectively. The album peaked at number 14 in the UK and number 11 in the US, where it was certified platinum by the RIAA.\nComparing the two Wilburys albums, a reviewer in The New York Times wrote in November 1990: \"The superstar pop group stays close to 50's and 60's rock roots, drawing on blues, doo-wop, rockabilly and Buddy Holly. But their second album is faster, jokier, lighter and meaner than the first.\" Rolling Stone described the blending of the four participants' musical styles as \"seemingly effortless\", and said that the album showed they continued to enjoy their collaboration. In the years following Vol. 3, there was speculation about further Wilbury releases. Since Harrison was viewed as the de facto leader of the group, his death in November 2001 ended the possibility of any future projects.When Harrison's distribution deal with Warner Bros. expired in 1995, ownership of his Dark Horse Records catalog and the two Wilburys albums reverted to him, and the albums went out of print. On June 12, 2007, Vol. 1 and Vol. 3 were reissued by Rhino Records as The Traveling Wilburys Collection, packaged together with bonus tracks and a DVD.\n\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nTraveling WilburysClayton Wilbury (Jeff Lynne) \u2013 acoustic and electric guitars, bass, keyboards, lead and backing vocals\nSpike Wilbury (George Harrison) \u2013 acoustic, electric and slide guitars, mandolin, sitar, lead and backing vocals\nBoo Wilbury (Bob Dylan) \u2013 acoustic guitar, harmonica, lead and backing vocals\nMuddy Wilbury (Tom Petty) \u2013 acoustic guitar, lead and backing vocalsAdditional personnel\n\nBuster Sidebury (Jim Keltner) \u2013 drums, percussion\nJim Horn \u2013 saxophones\nRay Cooper \u2013 percussion\nKen Wilbury (Gary Moore) \u2013 lead guitar on \"She's My Baby\"\nEric Idle (as Prof. \"Tiny\" Hampton) - liner notesEngineered by\nRichard Dodd\n\nCharts\nPassage 3:\nThe First Flower\nThe First Flower is Play Dead's debut album, recorded at the Jungle Records studio in March 1983.

The song was released as the first single from the album, although it was only issued as a promotional single in the United States. The lead guitar part is played by Gary Moore.\nThe band filmed a music video for the single, which was directed by David Leland and produced by Limelight Films. The clip shows the four Wilburys and drummer Jim Keltner performing the track and a snippet of Dylan riding a bike on the set.

From 1 May 1910, most services from Adelaide station were extended to terminate at Aldgate. On 1 July 1929, the westbound platform was converted to an island platform. In 1974, the goods siding was replaced by a second crossing loop. It was very similar to Blackwood; the station building and shelter were the same.\nIt was closed to local trains on 23 September 1987, but until 1990 was available for passengers wishing to board the Mount Gambier-bound railcar service. At the time of closure, Aldgate had three platforms. Platform 1 was a 151-metre-long side platform, and platforms 2 and 3 were a 149-metre-long island platform. The island platform was demolished in the 1990s, but the side platform remains in place, although no longer in use. A crossing loop was provided, but was removed when the line was converted to standard gauge in 1995. The station building now functions as The Hut Community Centre.\nPassage 2:\nStirling, South Australia\nStirling is a town in the Adelaide Hills, South Australia, approximately 15 km from the Adelaide city centre. It is administered by the Adelaide Hills Council. Neighbouring townships are Crafers and Aldgate. Other nearby towns are Heathfield and Bridgewater. Of those five, Stirling has by far the largest commercial strip, with the greatest number and widest variety of shops, and the only banks.\nStirling East, a similar sized area towards Aldgate, is home to several schools.\n\nHistory\nStirling is named after Edward Stirling. He was the illegitimate son of Archibald Stirling, a planter in the British West Indies, and a Creole woman. He was able to travel to South Australia because of a financial gift from his father who had been freshly compensated for his slaves on the emancipation of the British West Indies.Founded in 1854, Stirling grew rapidly as a result of the expansion of apple growing and market gardening to satisfy the demand of the expanding city of Adelaide, whose centre is only 15 kilometres from Stirling. It also developed as a residential address for English migrants who could afford it, to escape Adelaide's hot summers, often 10 degrees cooler than Adelaide. As a result, many historic, grand mansions can be found in the area. Today, farming has declined as more of the region has been urbanised, with many Stirling residents commuting to Adelaide daily.\n\nVegetation\nMany deciduous trees, particularly the maple, elm, oak and ash trees, have been imported from Europe and North America. These trees flourish in Stirling's wet and mild to cool climate and are a popular tourist attraction in the autumn months (April\u2013May), bringing rich and vibrant autumn leaf colour to the town. Some Australian cities are too warm (even in the autumn and winter months) to accommodate and produce maple trees, but some temperate regions along the eastern coast and towns at higher altitudes flourish in colour during autumn, rivalling those in North America, Europe and Japan.\nOther tourist sites include the nearby Mount Lofty Botanic Garden and Cleland National Park.\n\nClimate\nStirling has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csb). Owing to its location near Mount Lofty, Stirling is the wettest place in South Australia, receiving an average of 1,107 millimetres (43.6 inches) of rain per year\u2014more than twice the average of Adelaide. Between May and August, the average monthly rainfall is as high as 155 millimetres (over 6 inches), and in June 1916, over 450 millimetres fell. Mean summer temperatures are about 5 \u00b0C (9 \u00b0F) lower than in Adelaide, which may explain why Stirling was recommended as a desirable residence for English migrants and Adelaide's high society in the 20th century. Winters are distinctly cool particularly compared to Adelaide, with an average minimum of 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) and an average maximum of 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F).The Australian Bureau of Meteorology stopped the collection of weather data at Stirling from the 1980s onward.  Weather recording instruments were removed from the grounds of Australia Post's Stirling office following a commercial dispute between these two Australian government organisations.\n\nGovernment\nStirling is located in the state electorate of Heysen and in the federal Division of Mayo. The local council is the Adelaide Hills Council (formerly Stirling Council) in the Mt Lofty and Manoah wards.\n\nCulture\nA prominent landmark in Stirling is the historical Stirling Theatre, home to the Hills Musical Company, Stirling Players and Hills Youth Theatre. Stirling also has a strong affinity with books and has been referred to as South Australia's 'Book Village'. This relates to the close proximity of varied book venues Chapter Two Books, Matilda Bookshop, The Hut Book Shed and the Coventry Memorial Library.\n\nArtistic Community\nStirling has traditionally had a strong community of artists. Notable are abstract artist, Colin Russell Gardiner who was a former electrician and held many exhibitions in the 1970s and 1980s.\nMichael Plant Atchison OAM (4 August 1933 \u2013 16 February 2009) was an Australian cartoonist who worked for the South Australian Advertiser for over 40 years.\n\nFire Service\nThe Stirling community is protected from fire, road crash and hazardous materials by the Stirling Country Fire Service Volunteers.\nIn 2006, the Adelaide Hills Council stepped up efforts to relocate the station to Crafers, against the wants of the volunteers. The council proposed the move in order to sell the land currently inhabited by the CFS station on Avenue Road, to fund a new library.  However, in mid-2006 the council elected to sell the land the fire station was on to SAFECOM (South Australian Fire and Emergency Services Commission), which owns all Fire Service assets.  The new library started construction anyway in early 2007, and it was completed the following year.\n\nTransport\nStirling (Main Street) is very well serviced by public transport, with a 30min off-peak service to the city and nearby Mount Barker (routes 864 and 864F). During peak it is also service by routes 863F and T863. Route 863 operates nights and weekends only. For the east of Stirling, route 865 operates to and from the city and route 866 operates to Crafers. Route 822 also links Stirling to Carey Gully. For the West of Stirling (heading out towards Heathfield) routes 865 and 894H operate via Avenue Road and Longwood Road, at peak times only with very limited interpeak services.\nPassage 3:\nElectoral district of Heysen\nHeysen is a single-member electoral district for the South Australian House of Assembly. It is named after Sir Hans Heysen, a prominent South Australian landscape artist. It is a 1,074 km\u00b2 electoral district that takes in some of the outer southern suburbs of Adelaide before fanning south-east to include most of the Adelaide Hills, as well as farming areas some distance from the capital. It includes the localities of Aldgate, Ashbourne, Belvidere, Biggs Flat, Blackfellows Creek, Blewitt Springs, Bradbury, Bridgewater, Bugle Ranges, Bull Creek, Chapel Hill, Clarendon, Crafers, Dingabledinga, Dorset Vale, Echunga, Flaxley, Gemmells, Green Hills Range, Heathfield, Highland Valley, Hope Forest, Ironbank, Jupiter Creek, Kangarilla, Kuitpo, Kuitpo Colony, Kyeema, Longwood, Macclesfield, McHarg Creek, Meadows, Montarra, Mount Magnificent, Mylor, Paris Creek, Prospect Hill, Red Creek, Salem, Sandergrove, Scott Creek, Stirling, Strathalbyn, The Range, Willunga Hill, Willyaroo, Wistow, Woodchester, Yundi; as well as parts of Bletchley, Hartley, Onkaparinga Hills, Upper Sturt. Although geographically it is a hybrid urban-rural seat, it is counted as a metropolitan seat.\nAs Heysen combines both wealthier suburbs in the foothills of the Adelaide Hills and rural areas further east, it has been held by the Liberal Party and its predecessor, the Liberal and Country League, ever since its creation in the electoral redistribution of 1969 as a replacement for Stirling. For most of that time, it has been a fairly safe to safe seat for the conservatives. It was first contested at the 1970 election. It was abolished at the 1977 election, forcing then-member David Wotton to move to the seat of Murray.  However, Wotton returned to Heysen when it was re-established at the 1985 election. He subsequently held the seat until his retirement in 2002, when he was replaced by former opposition leader Isobel Redmond. Redmond retired at the 2018 election and was replaced by Josh Teague.\nThe 1997 election saw the Democrats receive 47.9 percent of the two-candidate preferred vote, the closest they had ever come to a seat any Australian lower house (apart from the South Australian seat of Mitcham). The 2002 election saw the Democrats receive 46 percent of the two-candidate preferred vote. The 2006 election saw their vote collapse with Labor being brought back into the two-candidate race. That election saw the seat turn marginal against Labor for the first time ever; the Liberals were cut down to 53 percent of the two-party vote. Out of 47 lower house seats, the SA Greens have consistently polled strongest in Heysen. Greens candidate Lynton Vonow came within a few percent of winning the overlapping federal seat of Mayo at the 2008 by-election. Vonow contested Heysen for the Greens at the 2014 election and overtook the Labor candidate coming second after preferences with a 39 percent two-candidate preferred vote from a 19.7 percent primary vote. The Greens also polled well in neighbouring seats such as Kavel and Davenport with primary votes over 15 percent. The 2018 election saw Nick Xenophon's SA-BEST receive 48.2 percent of the two-candidate preferred vote in Heysen which was the closest they came to winning a lower house seat.\nAt the 2022 state election, the Liberals fell to only 51 percent of the two-party vote amid their statewide collapse, only the second time the seat had been marginal against Labor.\n\nMembers for Heysen\nElection results\nNotes\nPassage 4:\nG399/400 Beijing-Changchun Through Train\nThe G399/400 Beijing-Changchun Through Train (Chinese: G399/400\u6b21\u5317\u4eac\u5357\u5230\u957f\u6625\u9ad8\u901f\u52a8\u8f66\u7ec4\u5217\u8f66) is Chinese railway running between the capital Beijing to Changchun, capital of Jilin express passenger trains by the Shenyang Railway Bureau, Changchun passenger segment responsible for passenger transport task, Changchun originating on the Beijing train.

Hawkins, a well-known publican, in 1864. Hawkins, who had emigrated from London, England, to the Province of South Australia in 1842, already owned several hotels, including the nearby Crafers Inn in present-day Crafers. The pump which Hawkins had installed outside the hotel (and which gave the hotel its name) became a popular place to water the horses and bullock teams which passed through the area, and by 1870, a small settlement had been established. Hawkins claimed at that time that some 60,000 people a year passed through the hotel's doors. The hotel became quite famous, at one point being described as \"one of the best decorated of its kind in the colony\" with \"magnificent chandeliers\".The pump and hotel, and subsequently the town, were named after Aldgate in London. The word derives from ealdgate, the Old English word meaning \"old gate\". The Hills Land and Investment Company subdivided land in the Aldgate area and laid out part section 92, Hundred of Noarlunga for settlement in 1882, naming the town after the hotel.\n\n21st century\nAldgate's drainage system has suffered substantial problems and has been the result of drastic flooding through the main street. One of the worst cases of this occurred at around 8:00 AM 8 November 2005, which left most of the businesses in the main street flooded with significant damage. A recent ongoing project around Aldgate has been upgrading the drainage system.In 2009 and 2010 the intersection of Mount Barker Road, Strathalbyn Road and Kingsland Road in Aldgate was upgraded and streetscape works were carried out throughout the township.  To make way for the roadworks, the pump which was the centrepoint of the town was temporarily removed. It was reinstalled in May 2011 by the Adelaide Hills Council and now sits atop a pedestal on the footpath in the main street.A new fire station for the Aldgate Country Fire Service was completed in August 2009.\n\nHeritage listings\nThere are many locally and state heritage-listed sites in Aldgate. those listed in the South Australian Heritage Register:\nAldgate Crafts Shop\nAldgate Pump Hotel (see above)\nRaywood, formerly Arbury Park: dwelling (designed by Frank Kenneth Milne, commissioned by Sir Alexander Downer, listed 1989), garden, chapel, driveway and gates (listed 2000)\nStangate House and Garden, bequeathed in 1975 to the National Trust of South Australia\nWairoa, historic home and gardens occupied by Marbury School from 1972 to 2004, listed June 1989\n\nGovernance\nAldgate is in the Adelaide Hills Council local government area, the federal Division of Mayo and the state electoral district of Heysen.\n\nIn popular culture\nAldgate is mentioned in the Redgum song \"So Goodbye\" featured on the band's 1978 album If You Don't Fight You Lose.\nPassage 10:\nSouth Brighton railway station, Adelaide\nSouth Brighton railway station is a former railway station on the Seaford line in Adelaide, South Australia.

He began his long and prolific film career in the early days of silent film.\n\nBiography\nBorn in the southwestern Ontario city of St. Thomas, Dell Henderson started his acting career on the stage, but appeared in his first movie Monday Morning in a Coney Island Police Court in 1908. Henderson was a frequent associate of film pioneer D.W. Griffith since 1909 and appeared in numerous early Griffith shorts in Hollywood. Henderson also acted on a less prolific basis in the movies of producer Mack Sennett at Keystone Studios. In addition to acting, Henderson directed nearly 200 silent films between 1911 and 1928. Most of those films are forgotten or lost, but he also directed movies with silent stars like Harry Carey and Roscoe Arbuckle. Henderson also worked as a writer on numerous screenplays.After retiring from directing in 1927, Henderson returned to acting full time and played important supporting roles in King Vidor's The Crowd (1928) and as General Marmaduke Pepper in Show People (1928). The advent of sound film damaged Henderson's acting career, and he often had to play smaller roles. In the 1930s, he appeared on several occasions as a comic foil for such comedians as The Three Stooges, W. C. Fields and Laurel and Hardy. He often played somewhat pompous figures like judges, businessmen, detectives or mayors. Modern audiences will remember Henderson as the annoyed hospital president Dr. Graves in The Three Stooges film Men in Black (1934) and the put-upon chaperone in the Our Gang film Choo-Choo! (1932). He also appeared as a night court judge in Laurel and Hardy's Our Relations (1936) and as a friendly car salesman in Leo McCarey's drama Make Way for Tomorrow (1937). Henderson ended his film career after numerous small roles in 1950.  He did make one final appearance on NBC-TV's \"This Is Your Life\" on March 10, 1954, during a tribute to Mack Sennett.\nHenderson died at the age of 79 of a heart attack in Hollywood. He was married to actress Florence Lee until his death. The couple made several silent films together.\n\nSelected filmography\nPassage 3:\nThe Blue Angel\nThe Blue Angel (German: Der blaue Engel) is a 1930 German musical comedy-drama film directed by Josef von Sternberg and starring Marlene Dietrich, Emil Jannings and Kurt Gerron. Written by Carl Zuckmayer, Karl Vollm\u00f6ller and Robert Liebmann, with uncredited contributions by Sternberg, it is based on Heinrich Mann's 1905 novel Professor Unrat (Professor Filth) and set in an unspecified northern German port city. The Blue Angel presents the tragic transformation of a respectable professor into a cabaret clown and his descent into madness. The film was the first feature-length German sound film and brought Dietrich international fame. It also introduced her signature song, Friedrich Hollaender and Robert Liebmann's \"Falling in Love Again (Can't Help It)\". The film is considered a classic of German cinema.\nThe film was shot simultaneously in German- and English-language versions. Though the English version was once considered a lost film, a print was discovered in a German film archive, restored and screened at San Francisco's Berlin and Beyond film festival on January 19, 2009. The German version is considered to be \"obviously superior\"; it is longer and not marred by actors struggling with English pronunciation.\n\nPlot\nImmanuel Rath is a professor at the local Gymnasium (high school for students expected to proceed to university) in Weimar Germany. The boys disrespect and play pranks on him. Rath punishes several of his students for circulating photographs of the beautiful Lola Lola, the headliner at the local cabaret called The Blue Angel. Hoping to catch the boys at the club, Rath goes there later that evening. He does find some students there, but while chasing them, he also finds Lola backstage and becomes infatuated with her. When he returns to the cabaret the following evening to return a pair of panties that was smuggled into his coat by one of his students, he spends the night with her. The next morning, reeling from his night of passion, Rath arrives late to school to find his classroom in chaos; the principal is furious and demands Rath's resignation.\nRath resigns his position at the school and marries Lola. Their happiness is short-lived, however, as Rath becomes humiliatingly dependent on Lola. Over several years, he sinks lower and lower, first selling dirty postcards, and then becoming a clown in Lola's troupe to pay the bills. His growing insecurities about Lola's profession as a \"shared woman\" eventually consume him with lust and jealousy.\nThe troupe returns to The Blue Angel, where everyone attends to watch the former professor play a clown. On stage, Rath is humiliated by the magician Kiepert, who breaks eggs on Rath's head, and by seeing Lola embrace and kiss the strongman Mazeppa. Rath is enraged to the point of insanity. He attempts to strangle Lola, but Mazeppa and others subdue him and lock him in a straitjacket.\nLater that night, Rath is released and he revisits his old classroom. Rejected, humiliated and destitute, he dies clutching the desk at which he once taught.\n\nCast\nMusic\n\"Ich bin von Kopf bis Fu\u00df auf Liebe eingestellt\" (\"Falling in Love Again (Can't Help It)\": Music and lyrics by Friedrich Hollaender, sung by Marlene Dietrich\n\"Ich bin die fesche Lola\" (\"They Call Me Naughty Lola\"): Music by Hollaender, lyrics by Robert Liebmann, sung by Dietrich\n\"Nimm Dich in Acht vor blonden Frau'n\" (\"Beware of Blond Women\"): Music by Hollaender, lyrics by Richard Rillo, sung by Dietrich\n\"Kinder, heut' abend, da such' ich mir was aus\" (\"A Man, Just a Regular Man\"): Music by Hollaender, lyrics by Liebmann, sung by DietrichThe film also features the famous carillon of the Garrison Church at Potsdam playing \"\u00dcb' immer Treu und Redlichkeit\" (\"Always Be True and Faithful\") as well as an orchestral version of the song. The original melody was composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart for Papageno's aria \"Ein M\u00e4dchen oder Weibchen\" from The Magic Flute. In the German Reich and subsequently the Weimar Republic, the lyrics of \"\u00dcb' immer Treu und Redlichkeit\" symbolized Prussian virtues: \"Use always fidelity and honesty / Up to your cold grave / And stray not one inch / From the ways of the Lord\".\n\nBackground\nBy 1929, Sternberg had completed a number of films for Paramount, none of which were box-office successes. However, Paramount's sister studio in Germany, UFA, asked him to direct Emil Jannings in his first sound film. Jannings was the Oscar-winning star of Sternberg's 1928 film The Last Command, and had specially requested Sternberg's participation, despite an \"early clash of temperaments\" on the set.Though The Blue Angel and Morocco, both from 1930, are often cited as his first sound films, Sternberg had already directed \"a startling experiment\" in asynchronous sound techniques with his 1929 Thunderbolt.\n\nCasting Lola Lola\nSinger Lucie Mannheim was favored by UFA producer Erich Pommer for the part of Lola, with support from leading man Emil Jannings, but Sternberg vetoed her as insufficiently glamorous for a major production. Sternberg also rejected author Heinrich Mann's actress-girlfriend Trude Hesterberg. Brigitte Helm, seriously considered by Sternberg, was not available for the part. Sternberg and Pommer settled on stage and film actress K\u00e4the Haack for the amount of 25,000 Reichsmarks.Sternberg first saw 29-year-old Marie Magdalene \"Marlene\" Dietrich at a music revue called the Zwei Krawatten (Two Neckties), which was produced by dramatist Georg Kaiser. Sternberg began immediately to groom Dietrich into \"the woman he saw she could become.\"\nCritic Andrew Sarris remarks on the irony of the relationship: \"Josef von Sternberg is too often subordinated to the mystique of Marlene Dietrich...the Svengali-Trilby publicity that enshrouded The Blue Angel \u2013 and the other six Sternberg-Dietrich film collaborations \u2013 obscured the more meaningful merits not only of these particular works but of Sternberg's career as a whole.\"\n\nProduction\nAfter arriving at Berlin's UFA studios, Sternberg declined an offer to direct a film about Rasputin, the former Russian spiritual advisor to the family of Czar Nicholas II. However, he was intrigued with a story by socialist reformer Heinrich Mann entitled Professor Unrat (Professor Filth) (1905), which critiques \"the false morality and corrupt values of the German middle class,\" and agreed to adapt it.The narrative of Mann's story was largely abandoned by Sternberg (with Mann's consent), retaining only scenes describing an affair between a college professor of high rectitude who becomes infatuated with a promiscuous cabaret singer. During filming, Sternberg altered dialogue, added scenes and modified cast characterizations that \"gave the script an entirely new dimension.\" The professor's descent from sexual infatuation to jealous rage and insanity was entirely Sternberg's invention.In order to maximize the film's profitability, The Blue Angel was filmed in both German and English, shot in tandem for efficiency. The shooting spanned 11 weeks, from 4 November 1929 to 22 January 1930, at an estimated budget of $500,000\u2014remarkably expensive for a UFA production of that period.During filming, although he was still the nominal star of the film (with top billing), Jannings became jealous over the growing closeness between Sternberg and Dietrich and engaged in histrionics and threatened quit the production. The Blue Angel was to be his last great cinematic moment, and it was also one of UFA's last successful films. Sarris comments on this double irony:\n\n\"The ultimately tragic irony of The Blue Angel is double-edged in a way Sternberg could not have anticipated when he undertook the project. The rise of Lola Lola and fall of Professor Immanuel Rath in reel [sic] life is paralleled in the real life by the rise of Marlene Dietrich and the fall of Emil Jannings...\"\n\nRelease\nThe Blue Angel was scheduled for its Berlin premiere on 1 April 1930, but UFA owner and industrialist Alfred Hugenberg, unhappy with socialist Heinrich Mann's association with the production, blocked release. Production manager Pommer defended the film, and Mann issued a statement distancing his anti-bourgeois critique from Sternberg's more sympathetic portrayal of professor Immanuel Rath in his movie version. Sternberg, who declared himself apolitical, had departed the country in February, shortly after the film was completed, and conflict ensued. Hugenberg ultimately relented on grounds of financial expediency, still convinced that Sternberg had concealed within The Blue Angel \"a parody of the German bourgeoisie.\"The film proved to be \"an instant international success.\" Dietrich, at Sternberg's insistence, was brought to Hollywood under contract to Paramount, where the studio would film and release Morocco in 1930 before The Blue Angel would appear in American theatres in 1931.\n\nThemes and analysis\nThe Blue Angel, ostensibly a story of the downfall of a respectable middle-age academic at the hands of a pretty young cabaret singer, is Sternberg's \"most brutal and least humorous\" film of his \u0153uvre. The harshness of the narrative \"transcends the trivial genre of bourgeois male corrupted by bohemian female\" and the complexity of Sternberg's character development rejects \"the old stereotype of the seductress\" who ruthlessly cuckolds her men.Sarris outlines Sternberg's \"complex interplay\" between Lola and the professor:\n\n\"The Blue Angel achieved its most electrifying effects through careful grading and construction. When Dietrich sings \"Falling in Love Again\" for the first time, the delivery is playful, flirtatious, and self-consciously seductive. The final rendition is harsher, colder, and remorseless. The difference in delivery is not related to the old sterotype of the seductress finally showing her true colors, but rather to a psychological development in Dietrich's Lola from mere sensual passivity to a more forceful fatalism about the nature of her desires. Lola's first instinct is to accept the Professor's paternal protection and her last is to affirm her natural instincts, not as coquettish expedients but as the very terms by which she expresses her existence. Thus, as the Professor has been defeated by Lola's beauty, Lola has been ennobled by the Professor's jealousy...\"\nBiographer John Baxter echoes this the key thematic sequence that reveals \"the tragic dignity\" of Rath's downfall:\n\n \"[T]he tragedy of Immanuel Rath was not that he lost his head over a woman, but that he could not reconcile the loss of power with the acquisition of freedom.\" When Rath is forced to relinquish \"his authority [over] his students, he sinks into alienated apathy\u2026Rath's failure to grasp the chance opened to him\u2026is portrayed in terms of his increasing silence, as he sinks more and more sullenly into the guise of the ridiculous, ironically named clown\u2026In the end, the authoritarian master of language is bereft of articulate speech\", finally erupting into a \"paraoxysmic cockscrow\" when he discovers that he has been cuckolded by Lola.\nWhen Rath, in a jealous rage, enters the room where Lola is making love to the cabaret strongman Mazeppa, Sternberg declines to show Rath, now a madman, at the moment when he is violently subdued by the authorities and placed in a straitjacket. Sternberg rewards the degraded Professor Rath for having \"achieved a moment of masculine beauty [by] crowing like a maddened rooster\" at Lola's deception: \"Sternberg will not cheapen that moment by degrading a man who has been defeated.\" Sternberg presents \"the spectacle of a prudent, prudish man blocked off from all means of displaying his manhood except the most animalistic.\" The loss of Lola leaves Rath with but one alternative: death.\n\nRemakes, adaptations and parodies\nThe Blue Angel (1959), director Edward Dmytryk's remake with Curd J\u00fcrgens.\nPousse-Cafe, a 1966 Broadway musical version with music by Duke Ellington.

He and his wife, Olga, were murdered in the Holocaust.\n\nLife\nBorn Kurt Gerson into a well-off merchant family in Berlin, he studied medicine before being called up for military service in World War I. After being seriously wounded, he was qualified as a military doctor in the German Army, despite having been only in his second year at university. After the war Gerron turned to a stage career, becoming a theatre actor under director Max Reinhardt in 1920. He appeared in secondary roles in several silent films and began directing film shorts in 1926.\nGerron's popular cinema breakthrough came with The Blue Angel (Der Blaue Engel, 1930) opposite Marlene Dietrich. Two years before, Gerron originated the role of \"Tiger\" Brown in the 1928 premiere production of The Threepenny Opera (Die Dreigroschenoper) at the Berlin Theater am Schiffbauerdamm, in which he also performed the first public performance of the song, \"Mack the Knife\". With the show's international success, Gerron's name and recorded voice became well known across Europe.\n\nUnder the Nazis\nAfter the 1933 seizure of power by the Nazis (known today as the Machtergreifung), Gerron left Nazi Germany with his wife and parents, traveling first to Paris and later to Amsterdam. He continued work there as an actor at the Stadsschouwburg and directed several movies. Several times he was offered employment in Hollywood through the agency of Peter Lorre and Josef von Sternberg, but Gerron refused to leave Europe.\nAfter the Wehrmacht occupied the Netherlands, Gerron and his parents were first interned in the transit camp at Westerbork. His parents were deported on May 5, 1943, and murdered in Sobibor. Gerron and his wife were later sent to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. There he was forced by the SS to stage the cabaret review, Karussell, in which he reprised Mack the Knife, as well as compositions by Martin Roman and other imprisoned musicians and artists.\nIn 1944, Gerron was coerced into directing a Nazi propaganda film intended to be viewed in \"neutral\" nations such as Switzerland, Sweden, and Ireland, for example, showing how \"humane\" conditions were at Theresienstadt. Once filming was finished, Gerron and members of the Jazz pianist Martin Roman's Ghetto Swingers were deported on the camp's final train transport to Auschwitz, on 28 October.  Gerron and his wife were murdered in the gas chamber immediately upon arrival on 30 October 1944, along with the film's entire performing entourage (except for Roman and guitarist Coco Schumann). The next day, Reichsf\u00fchrer SS Heinrich Himmler ordered the closure of the gas chambers.\nAll known complete prints of Gerron's final film, which was to have been called Theresienstadt.

Roberts, was an American film editor who edited over 100 films during his almost 30-year career.\n\nLife and career\nArthur Roberts began editing towards the end of the silent era of the film industry, his first film being 1927's The College Hero, directed by Walter Lang. His last film was Republic's Lay That Rifle Down in 1955, after which he spent a brief period as the editor for the television series, Lassie, before retiring in 1956. During his career he would work with many famous directors, including Frank Capra (on several films, including The Donovan Affair), Lowell Sherman (on The Royal Bed), William Seiter (on several films, including Way Back Home), Edward F. Cline (on Cracked Nuts), George Cukor (on A Bill of Divorcement), Dorothy Arzner (the first female member of the DGA, on Christopher Strong), Anthony Mann (Strangers in the Night), George Archainbaud (Girls of the Big House), Fritz Lang (House by the River),\n\nFilmography\n(Per AFI database)\nPassage 4:\nGeorge Archainbaud\nGeorge Archainbaud (May 7, 1890 \u2013 February 20, 1959) was a French-American film and television director.\n\nBiography\nIn the beginning of his career he worked on stage as an actor and manager. He came to the United States in January 1914, and started his film career as an assistant director to Emile Chautard at the World Film Company in Fort Lee, New Jersey.  In 1917 he made his own directorial debut As Man Made Her. During the next three and a half decades he directed over one hundred films. After the beginning of the 1950s he moved to television.\nWhile working at RKO Radio Pictures in the beginning of the 1930s, he showed some artistic and skillful eye with many of his films. The finest examples include Thirteen Women (1932), a story of ethnic discrimination and revenge, with Myrna Loy as a half-caste Hindu; The Lost Squadron (1932), a memorable thriller about Hollywood stunt flyers, who risk their lives under the direction of monstrous Erich von Stroheim; Penguin Pool Murder (1932) and Murder on the Blackboard (1934), the first two films of the RKO trilogy starring Edna May Oliver as Miss Hildegarde Withers, a teacher and amateur investigator created by American writer Stuart Palmer; and later in his career the RKO drama Hunt the Man Down (1950), a film noir starring Gig Young which seems more concerned in showing the post-war transformation of seven characters since 1938, than the investigation to solve a murder case.\nAlthough Archainbaud directed films of all genres, he is nowadays mainly linked with westerns. In fact, it was not until the last decade of his directorial career until he specialized in them. With the producer Harry Sherman he made several Hopalong Cassidy oaters. Later he was also one of the principal directors of Gene Autry's Flying A Productions, at which he made several episodes for such weekly television series as Buffalo Bill, Jr., Annie Oakley and The Adventures of Champion.\nIn 1921 he married actress Katherine Johnston (1890 \u2013 1969), whose last film was The Flapper (1920). He died in 1959 and is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale).\n\nPartial filmography\nPassage 5:\nCynthia Mort\nCynthia Mort (born June 18, 1956) is an American director, screenwriter, and producer. Mort has worked primarily in television since beginning her career in 1994, writing for the sitcom Roseanne. Her notable works include the HBO series Tell Me You Love Me as a creator and executive producer, the revenge film The Brave One (2007) as a screenwriter, and the biopic Nina (2016) as a director.\n\nBiography\nMort was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nCareer\nTelevision\nMort began her career as a screenwriter in 1994. She wrote multiple episodes for the sitcom Roseanne, and was later a producer on the show. She continued in television as a writer and producer for the program Will and Grace.In 2007, Mort created and produced the drama Tell Me You Love Me, which aired on HBO, and starred an ensemble cast including Jane Alexander and Adam Scott. The plot of the program closely examines various struggles that may arise in a committed marriage. The series gained notoriety for including highly graphic simulated sexual sequences, to the point that audiences asked whether the actors actually engaged in sexual intercourse on camera. The series ended after one season.Mort co-wrote a pilot episode for HBO called Tilda in 2011, but experienced conflicts with her co-writer Bill Condon. The project was not picked up as a series.\n\nWriting in film\nMort, along with Roderick Taylor and Bruce A. Taylor, wrote the screenplay for the 2007 film The Brave One. The film features Jodie Foster as a woman seeking revenge on the men who killed her fianc\u00e9.\n\nNina, controversy, and lawsuit\nIn 2016, Mort released her first film as a director, Nina, a biopic chronicling the life of singer Nina Simone. The film elicited a strong negative response from both critics and audiences alike as a result of Mort's choice to cast actress Zoe Saldana in the title role, despite discrepancies between the two women's skin colours. The film and its creators were accused of perpetuating blackface by darkening Saldana's skin to play the role.Furthermore, the film underwent another controversy in which Mort filed a lawsuit against the producers of Nina in 2014, after finding that choices made by the company compromised her long-standing artistic vision of the film.  As a result, the film was not released for another two years, and while Mort has expressed her support for the project, she maintains that the final result does not properly reflect her work.\n\nPersonal life\nMort is a lesbian. She was involved in a long-term relationship with actress Melanie Mayron and helped raise Mayron's children until their separation in 2008. Mort's personal life garnered attention after the release of The Brave One for her rumoured adulterous romance with actress Jodie Foster, who starred in the film. Both Foster and Mort broke up with their partners and began dating each other, but ended their relationship the following year.\n\nFilmography\nFilm\nTelevision\nSee also\nList of female film and television directors\nList of lesbian filmmakers\nPassage 6:\nAlias French Gertie\nAlias French Gertie is an American pre-Code crime film directed by George Archainbaud from a screenplay by Wallace Smith, based upon the unproduced play The Chatterbox by Bayard Veiller. The film stars Bebe Daniels and Ben Lyon, who were making their first on-screen appearance together. A copy of this film survives in the Library of Congress.\n\nPlot\n\"French Gertie\" is a jewel thief; posing as French maid named Marie.

When a good-hearted detective, Kelcey, lets them off the hook with the promise that they will go straight, they agree.\n\nCast\nReception\nThe New York Times critic, Mordaunt Hall, gave the film a lukewarm review, praising the acting of Bebe Daniels, while not being as kind to Ben Lyon. Overall, he said the film, \"... has not been handled with the subtlety and smoothness it deserves. Nevertheless, up to a certain point, it is a production that holds the interest, but what should have been the main idea is sacrificed for a more obvious turn of events.\"\n\nNotes\nThis is the first film in which Bebe Daniels and Ben Lyon co-starred. They were married a short time afterwards, in June 1930, and the two remained married until her death in 1971. The play from which this screenplay was adapted, The Chatterbox, does not appear to have ever been produced.The film was a remake of the 1925 FBO silent film, Smooth as Satin, starring Evelyn Brent and Bruce Gordon, and directed by Ralph Ince.\nPassage 7:\nHoppy Serves a Writ\nHoppy Serves a Writ is a 1943 Western film directed by George Archainbaud and starring William Boyd as Hopalong Cassidy, the 43rd of 66 Cassidy features. The supporting cast features his regular sidekicks Andy Clyde and Jay Kirby, as well as Victor Jory and George Reeves. The film remains noteworthy today as one of the earliest performances (his 2nd) of unshaven newcomer Robert Mitchum, who made an impression upon the studio by generating a surprising fan mail response exactly as Clark Gable had after playing an extremely similar unshaven role in The Painted Desert, a Western starring William Boyd produced a dozen years earlier.\n\nPlot\nCattle rustler and stagecoach hold-up man Tom Jordan and his gang have been terrorizing the ranchers and other citizens of Mason City. Sheriff Hoppy is implored to bring them to justice, but their hideout is across the border in Oklahoma, outside his jurisdiction.

The screenplay was written by J. Walter Ruben, from Wallace Smith's adaptation of a story by Barney A. Sarecky (the producer's brother). It was one of the films that earned a positive return for RKO that year, turning a profit of $30,000.\n\nPlot\nLarry Sheldon is a gambler, who learns that a friend of his has been murdered by a local gangster, Spot Willis. When he goes to confront Spot, a melee ensues in which Spot winds up dead. Thinking that he is responsible for the death, Sheldon flees the city aboard a train, with his companion, Chick.

The highway runs 14.139 miles (22.755 km) from the Massachusetts state line in Richmond, where the highway continues as Massachusetts Route 32, north to NH 12 in Keene. NH 32 connects the southern Cheshire County towns of Richmond and Swanzey with Keene and Athol, Massachusetts.\n\nRoute description\nNH 32 begins at the Massachusetts state line in the town of Richmond. The highway continues south as Massachusetts Route 32 (Richmond-Athol Road), which heads through Royalston toward Athol. NH 32 heads north as two-lane Athol Road to the center of Richmond, where the highway intersects NH 119 (Winchester Road/Fitzwilliam Road). The highway continues north as Old Homestead Highway, which enters the valley of the South Branch of the Ashuelot River as the route enters the town of Swanzey. NH 32 passes near the village of East Swanzey, through Swanzey proper, and then North Swanzey after entering the valley of the main stem of the river. In North Swanzey, the highway passes Dillant\u2013Hopkins Airport. NH 32 enters the city of Keene immediately before it reaches its northern terminus at NH 12 (Main Street).\n\nJunction list\nThe entire route is in Cheshire County.\nPassage 2:\nWest Chesterfield, New Hampshire\nWest Chesterfield is an unincorporated community in the town of Chesterfield in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States. It is located north of New Hampshire Route 9 in a valley leading to the Connecticut River. Via Route 9, Brattleboro, Vermont, is 3 miles (5 km) to the west, and Keene, New Hampshire, is 14 miles (23 km) to the east.\nWest Chesterfield has a separate ZIP code (03466) from the rest of Chesterfield.\nPassage 3:\nJaffrey Center Historic District\nThe Jaffrey Center Historic District encompasses the traditional civic heart of the small town of Jaffrey, New Hampshire.  The district lies to the west of the Jaffrey's main business district, extending along Main Street (New Hampshire Route 124) from Harkness Road to the Jaffrey Common, and along Thorndike Pond Road northward from Main Street.  It includes the town's oldest civic buildings, and was its main center until the mills of East Jaffrey eclipsed it.  The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.\n\nDescription and history\nThe district retains the feel of an 18th-19th century rural village, and includes elements dating to shortly after the town's incorporation in 1773.  The old burying ground was established in 1774, and the old meeting house (now a cultural center) was raised in 1775.  The district includes 19th century school houses, and houses that were built in the 18th and 19th centuries, in predominantly Georgian, Federal, and Greek Revival styles.  One of the town's early industries is also represented, in the remnants of a tannery established c. 1810 at the east end of the district.The area's importance as an economic as well as civic center arose  after completion of the Third New Hampshire Turnpike (now NH 124).  The turnpike brought travelers, who stopped at inns and taverns in the center, and goods, which were sold to local farmers.  Melville Academy, a secondary school, was founded in 1832, and its 1833 building is now a local museum.  The area remained of some significance even as East Jaffrey's mills became more prominent, as it catered in the late 19th century to vacationers drawn to nearby Mount Monadnock.\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Cheshire County, New Hampshire\nPassage 4:\nNew Jersey Route 124\nRoute 124 is a state highway in the northern part of New Jersey in the United States that is 14.74 mi (23.72 km) long. It is the eastern section of what used to be Route 24 before that road was realigned to its current freeway alignment. The western end is at an intersection with U.S. Route 202 (US 202) and County Route 510 (CR 510) in Morristown, Morris County; the eastern end continues as CR 603 on Springfield Avenue at the border between Maplewood and Irvington in Essex County. The route runs through suburban areas of Morris County, passing through Madison and Chatham. It interchanges with Route 24 on the border of Millburn, Essex County and Summit, Union County and serves as a frontage road for that route. Upon splitting from Route 24, Route 124 continues east through Springfield Township, Union Township, and Maplewood to its eastern terminus.\nThe alignment of today's Route 124 was first designated as a part of pre-1927 Route 5 in 1916, a route that was to run from Delaware, Warren County to Newark. In 1927, this portion of the route became a part of Route 24, a route that was to run from Phillipsburg to Newark. A freeway, which is the current alignment of Route 24, was proposed for this portion of the route in the 1950s that was approved in 1960. Route 24 was moved to the new freeway between the John F. Kennedy Parkway on the Millburn/Summit border and Interstate 78 (I-78) in 1972, with Route 124 being designated along the former alignment of Route 24 east of this point. In 1992, the Route 24 freeway was completed between I-287 in Hanover Township and the John F. Kennedy Parkway. As a result, Route 124 was extended west along the former Route 24 to U.S. Route 202 in Morristown.\n\nRoute description\nMorris County\nRoute 124 begins at the intersection of US 202 and CR 510 at the Park Place square in the downtown of Morristown, Morris County. From here, it heads to the southeast as South Street, a two-lane undivided road that passes businesses. At the intersection with CR 663, the road widens to four lanes. A short distance later, CR 601 continues southeast on South Street and Route 124 bears left to head east on Madison Avenue, coming to an interchange with Interstate 287. Past this interchange, the road passes Morristown Memorial Hospital and continues through mainly commercial areas with some homes. At the intersection with Normandy Parkway, the route turns to the southeast and enters Morris Township, where it narrows to two lanes again, with NJ Transit\u2019s Morristown Line running a short distance to the northeast of the route near the Morris County Golf Club. Route 124 continues into more residential areas and crosses into Madison.Here, the route passes near some business parks before intersecting CR 636, where it is briefly a four-lane road. Past this intersection, the road passes between residential neighborhoods to the northeast and Drew University to the southwest. Route 124 crosses over the Morristown Line near James Park and becomes Main Street, heading southeast through the commercial downtown of Madison. Here, the road intersects CR 647 and CR 608. Past the Rosedale Avenue intersection, the route heads into a mix of residential and business areas.  Route 124 enters Chatham at the intersection with Brooklake Road/Division Avenue. In the center of the town, the route intersects CR 638 and CR 607 before continuing east.\n\nEssex and Union counties\nRoute 124 crosses the Passaic River and runs along the border of Millburn, Essex County, to the north and Summit, Union County, coming to a large interchange with the Route 24 freeway and CR 649 (John F. Kennedy Parkway). Here, the route becomes a frontage road for the Route 24 freeway that has two lanes in each direction. The road passes to the south of The Mall at Short Hills before running through the Canoe Brook Country Club. It heads southeast into wooded residential neighborhoods and intersects Union CR 657, where the Route 124 frontage road has ramps to Route 24. A short distance later, the route passes an overpass to nowhere that crosses over Route 24 at Brantwood Drive which was closed and walled off. The Route 124 frontage road has since eliminated the intersection at Brantwood Drive. In 2013, City of Summit vacated the 50-foot public right of way of the old road section from Route 124 into the current Brantwood Drive. In a short distance, Route 124 intersects CR 608, at which point the route has an eastbound ramp to eastbound Route 24 and a westbound ramp from westbound Route 24. Past this intersection, the Route 124 frontage road along Route 24 ends and the route becomes a two-lane undivided road called South Service Road that closely parallels the north side of Route 24, passing under the Morristown Line. The route heads past businesses and forms the border of Millburn to the north and Springfield Township, Union County to the south, coming to an intersection with CR 512 near an interchange with Route 24. There is a direct ramp from westbound Route 124 to Route 24 a short distance to the northwest of this intersection.\n\nFrom here, the route passes more commercial establishments as a four-lane road, heading farther from Route 24, before crossing CR 527. At this intersection, Route 124 entirely enters Springfield Township and becomes Morris Avenue, passing a mix of residences and businesses. The route passes under I-78 without an interchange and becomes a two-lane road that passes through the downtown of Springfield, eventually widening to four lanes again.  In this area, it intersects CR 635. Route 124 comes to a circular junction with Route 82 and CR 577. Here, Route 82 continues southeast on Morris Avenue, CR 509 Spur heads south, and CR 577 heads north. Route 124, meanwhile, briefly splits into a one-way pair here. The eastbound direction heads south on Meisel Avenue before turning north along Maple Avenue while the westbound direction follows Springfield Avenue. The two directions of Route 124 rejoin and follow four-lane divided Springfield Avenue northeast to a crossing of the Rahway River and a partial interchange with I-78. Here, there are ramps from the local lanes of eastbound I-78 to both directions of Route 124, to the local lanes of westbound I-78 and Route 24 from both directions of Route 124, and to the express lanes of westbound Interstate 78 from westbound Route 124.\n\nPast this interchange, the route enters Union Township and continues east through developed areas, intersecting CR 638 before narrowing into a two-lane undivided road and intersecting CR 630. It continues through more urban commercial areas before intersecting CR 630 again. At this point, Route 124 crosses into Maplewood, Essex County and becomes a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane that is locally maintained. This road heads east through the downtown of Maplewood, coming to an intersection with CR 601.  A short distance later, the Route 124 designation ends at the border of Maplewood and Irvington. From this point, Springfield Avenue continues east as CR 603, which heads toward Newark and ends at CR 510, which follows Springfield Avenue for a short distance before becoming Market Street.\n\nHistory\nWhat is modern-day Route 124 was created as part of two turnpikes; the Morris Turnpike, running from Elizabeth to Newton, and the Springfield and Newark Turnpike, from Springfield to Newark. The road was later incorporated into the William Penn Highway, which ran from Jersey City to Pittsburgh, before being designated as a part of pre-1927 Route 5, a route that was legislated in 1916 to run from Delaware in Warren County east to Newark. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, this portion of pre-1927 Route 5 became a part of Route 24, a road that was to run from Phillipsburg to Newark. In the 1950s, plans were made to bypass this portion of Route 24 with a freeway running from Interstate 287 in Hanover Township to Interstate 78 in Springfield Township; this was approved of in 1960. This freeway was completed between Interstate 78 and the John F. Kennedy Parkway in 1972. The Route 24 designation was moved to the new freeway and Route 124 was designated along the former alignment of Route 24 east of this point, which included frontage roads built where the new freeway ran along the old alignment of the road. Following the completion of the Route 24 freeway to Interstate 287 in 1992, Route 124 was extended west along the former alignment of Route 24 between the John F. Kennedy Parkway and U.S. Route 202 in Morristown. In 2002, maintenance of the portion of Route 124 in Maplewood was transferred to the municipality from the New Jersey Department of Transportation.\n\nMajor intersections\nSee also\nU.S. Roads portal\n New Jersey portal\nPassage 5:\nDublin Pond\nDublin Pond or Dublin Lake is a 236-acre (0.96 km2) water body located in Cheshire County in southwestern New Hampshire, United States, in the town of Dublin.

At the northern corner stands an octagonal four-story tower topped by a crenellated parapet.  The interior of the building has two levels: the upper level houses an auditorium space with a stage at one end, with a balcony area that has been converted for use as offices.  The basement level houses additional offices.

The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.The town of Jaffrey was laid out in the 1740s, and incorporated in 1773. Its original town center, now the Jaffrey Center Historic District, was located near its geographic center. The village of East Jaffrey had its beginnings with the establishment of saw and grist mills on the Contoocook River in 1770 by John Boorland. The construction of a turnpike (now NH 124) near the mills in 1799 brought further economic activity. In 1814, the mill complex was replaced by a woolen mill, predecessor to the Jaffrey Mills buildings that now line the river north of the Main Street bridge. By the mid-19th century the area had seen significant growth, with a large number of Greek Revival houses, and a growing array of businesses and civic institutions. The arrival of the railroad in 1870 cemented the area's economic and civic importance.\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Cheshire County, New Hampshire\nPassage 9:\nNew Hampshire Route 78\nNew Hampshire Route 78 (abbreviated NH 78) is a 3.456-mile-long (5.562 km) secondary state highway in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States.

The attack, in the heavily fortified Green Zone of Baghdad, occurred ten minutes after the Council of Representatives had adjourned for lunch. It was on the first floor of the Baghdad Convention Center, which houses the parliament. Two further unexploded suicide vests were found near the canteen. The building had earlier been searched by dogs \u2013 very rare considering dogs are considered ritually unclean by Iraqis \u2013 suggesting the authorities suspected an attack was imminent. Following the attack the government closed down mobile phone networks and Apache helicopters flew overhead.\n\nCasualties\nThe US military reported on 13 April that only MP Mohammed Awad had died, and that 22 others were wounded.Early reports however had said that eight people were killed, including three MPs, and at least 23 people were reported wounded. The MPs named were Mohammed Awad, a member of the Iraqi National Dialogue Front, Taha al-Liheibi, a member of the Iraqi Accordance Front and an unnamed Kurdish MP.\n\nResponsibility\nSuspicions initially centered on the bomber having been the bodyguard of an MP. A government spokesman said \"there are some groups that work in politics during the day and do things other than politics at night\". Member of Parliament Mohammed al-Dayni accused the government of lax security at the site.On 13 April, the Islamic State of Iraq posted a message on an Islamist website claiming to have sent \"A knight from the state of Islam ... [into] the heart of the Green Zone\" to carry out the attack. It is not clear whether this claim is genuine, though some who monitor such websites believe it is.In February 2009, two bodyguards of Iraqi National Dialogue Front MP Mohammed al-Dayni were arrested on suspicion of the attacks. Alaa Khairallah Hashim, al-Dayni's security chief and Ryadh Ibrahim al-Dayni, Mohammed al-Dayni's nephew, confessed on television to involvement in several attacks, including the parliament bombing. They said the MP had given authorisation for the bomber to enter the parliament area. The security forces asked the Council of Representatives of Iraq to lift al-Dayni's parliamentary immunity. Mohammed al-Dayni claimed that the accusations were lies and that his bodyguards had been tortured into making a false confession because he had been disclosing human rights abuses in Iraqi prisons. al-Dayni took a flight to Jordan, but the aeroplane was forced to turn back; parliament then agreed to lift his immunity.\n\nReactions\nWhen the bombing occurred, Saleh al-Mutlaq, the head of oppositional Iraqi National Dialogue Front, the party of the killed MP Awad, called on the United States to overthrow the government of Nouri al-Maliki: \"We need America to realize that this pro-Iranian government it has installed has allowed interference on the side of one against the other\".The Iraqi Council of Representatives held an emergency assembly the following day in response to the bombing, to \"show resilience in the face of such attacks\".US President George W. Bush condemned the attacks, saying \"there is an enemy willing to bomb innocent people and a symbol of democracy\". The Iranian Foreign Minister, Mohammad Ali Hosseini described the attack as \"inhumane and satanic ... target[ting] both its Shia and Sunni officials\"Four days later three Ministers from the Sadrist Movement quit the government, citing, among other things, the growing insecurity in Baghdad.\n\nSee also\n2007 suicide bombings in Iraq\nList of attacks on legislatures\nPassage 10:\nAnant Nag filmography\nAnant Nag is an Indian actor and occasional film producer who appears as an actor in predominantly in Kannada films and a few Hindi and Telugu films.

After a heated conversation at the kitchen table, Peter and David retrieve the unconscious Tracey from the car trunk. As they try to get her upstairs, Peter gets sidetracked by her chest, not realizing she has woken up. She headbutts him several times, and Peter screams with pain. David manages to get her off him and has to fix Peter's now bloody and broken nose after tying her to the bed frame. The pair hold her for ransom in a secluded country cottage. Things begin to go wrong when Arnie's dimwitted son and stepbrother of Tracey, Andrew, delivers the ransom. Instead of money, the bag is filled with napkins. David and Peter realize that not only have they been deceived, but Arnie knew about Andrew's involvement in the scheme all along.\nAfter Peter breaks David's phone by accidentally dropping it in water, David goes down to the village to use a telephone box to call in another ransom. While there, he happens across some sinister locals who, upon learning that he and his companions are staying at the Barnarby Cottage, warn him to keep his doors locked and not to wander. Disturbed, David returns to the cottage to find that Tracey \u2014 who has proven to be highly intelligent and resourceful, albeit foul-mouthed and somewhat psychopathic \u2014 has incapacitated Andrew and abducted Peter.\nSome distance away, Peter and Tracey arrive at an ominous-looking farm. Upon entering the house, they soon discover it to be the home of an insane and hideously deformed serial killer known only as the Farmer.\nAfter opening a trapdoor in the kitchen to reveal a secret staircase leading down into the cellar, Tracey is stabbed through the stomach by the Farmer. Terrified, Peter flees upstairs and jumps out of the bedroom window. Tracey survives her injury and calls out for Peter to help her escape, too, with the Farmer in pursuit. Peter incapacitates the Farmer with a shovel, saving Tracey's life. Tracey then urges Peter to kill the madman before he regains consciousness, but he is reluctant.\nAs the two of them argue, the Farmer comes to and quickly amputates the end of Peter's foot with the shovel. As he is about to kill Peter, Tracey begins mocking him, ordering him to hurry up and do it. Frustrated, the Farmer suddenly turns around and gruesomely decapitates her at mouth-level with the shovel. He then knocks out a hysterical Peter and hangs him by his jacket from a meat hook in the shed.\nMeanwhile, Andrew and David discover Andrew's hairdresser Steven, dying from being disemboweled before setting off through the woods in search of Peter and Tracey, when they stumble across the dead body of one of Arnie's henchmen, who has had his throat slit. Soon after, they arrive at the farm, where they discover a shed full of severed heads. David and Andrew hurry outside, where the Farmer pins David to the ground with a pickaxe through his leg. He then chases Andrew into the nearby horse stables, where he viciously attacks him with a hunting knife before ripping his spine out.\nPeter comes to and manages to release himself from the hook and crawl across the ground to David. After making up for a lifetime of squabbling, they vow to fight on and drag themselves back into the farmhouse in search of a phone. The Farmer soon reappears, tossing Andrew's severed head and spine through the window. David attempts to defend his brother, only to be suddenly impaled by The Farmer with the pickaxe. Outraged at seeing his brother murdered, Peter begins to throttle the Farmer to death by strangling him with a length of rope.\nThe Farmer manages to toss Peter down into the cellar and slam the door shut. But Peter still has the end of the rope, and he continues tugging on it, eventually causing the Farmer to collapse on top of the trap door. With the weight of the body on top of the door, Peter is unable to escape. With nowhere else to go, he descends down into the cellar. He flicks on his cigarette lighter to reveal the Farmer's equally insane and hideous wife and daughters standing all around him. He mutters, defeated, \"You must be joking\" before they set upon him; the lighter goes out, and Peter screams as they attack him.\nAfter the credits, Arnie and his right-hand men arrive at the farm.

The choirmaster is a young teacher, Elizabeth who is preparing the choir to enter a local musical choir competition called \"Shadow Song\". Arthur is also estranged from his son, James. Marion's health deteriorates over time until one night when she dies in her sleep. Arthur initially takes this loss severely and cuts himself from his family and the choir. Eventually he agrees to take Marion's place in the choir. The transition proves to be a challenge for Arthur thanks to the unconventional songbook that includes racier songs such as Salt-N-Pepa's \"Let's Talk About Sex\" and Mot\u00f6rhead's \"Ace of Spades\". However he grows to enjoy spending time in the choir.\nOn the eve of the competition, Arthur has an argument with James in a failed attempt to rebuild their relationship and pulls out of the choir.

When the doorbell rings and Christine goes to answer it, the couple is attacked by Rian (Jumayn Hunter), Asad (Ashley Chin), and Teddy (Sonny Muslim), who hold them both hostage and tie them up in their front room. Knowing Sebastian will be returning at 9pm, the group waits for his return so that they can get revenge on him for grassing on Rian's cousin and getting him sent to prison; Teddy leaves with Mike's credit cards to find a cash machine.\nRian suddenly drags Christine into another room to presumably rape her, leaving Asad to guard a frustrated Mike. Asad allows Mike to have a drink and explains that he is not as violent as Rian, and tells Mike details about his life. Rian's school friends, Beth (Jennie Jacques) and Charman (Corinne Douglas), and Beth's younger brother Oscar, then arrive with an axe for Rian to use on Sebastian. Oscar gets sent into the kitchen, while Teddy returns with Mike's money for Rian to send to his cousin.\nSebastian returns home and is dragged upstairs to his room by the teenagers, who begin to torture and beat him. Hearing his son's screams, Mike desperately struggles to free himself, and is able to knock a knife off the dinner table so that he can cut his wrists free. He goes into the next room to find a traumatised Christine tied up and naked underneath a blanket. Arming himself with a candlestick, he attempts to sneak upstairs, but his presence is alerted by Charman who was exiting the bathroom. Asad, Teddy, Charman, and Beth flee from the house, while Mike grapples with Rian, before finally beating him down with the candlestick and then his fists. Christine comes upstairs to comfort a bloodied, finger-less Sebastian who slowly loses consciousness in her arms, while she hysterically screams for Mike to do something. Mike goes downstairs to call 999, then goes into the kitchen to drink from the tap, when he senses someone behind him and turns around to see Oscar standing there. The film ends with Mike, knife in hand, and Oscar both staring at each other, unsure of what to do next.\n\nCast\nProduction\nBased on a specially written script template, the film was made for Steel Mill Pictures.

Metrodome Distribution holds the rights for the sales in England.\n\nCritical reception\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. The Film Blogger dubbed it a \"moderately tense thriller\", that was \"accentuated by a well-developed class commentary and some solid performances\".Anthony Quinn of the Independent wrote that \"Like Haneke, the director creates a mood of violence while holding off from graphic depiction \u2013 this is no torture porn. Its suggestion of a conscienceless underclass will be as a red rag to more conservative souls, but you suspect Williams won't care. He's becoming a real player in the cinema of ordeal\".Damon Wise, in his review for Empireonline.com, gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and claimed that \"After the histrionic Harry Brown and gory Eden Lake, you could be forgiven for thinking the hoodie-horror subgenre had run its course. But while this sparse, ingenious thriller might seem to cover familiar ground, Cherry Tree Lane delves deeper into the hoodie psyche with a degree of black comedy lacking from its forebears\". Wise added that \"The tense siege takes up most of the film\u2019s running time, but this is not so much torture porn as a dry, existential drama\".Daniel Stephens described Cherry Tree Lane as \"...more than just a workmanlike thriller. Like other recent British films that have looked at urban decay in the country, and in light of the recent riots in London and elsewhere, it feels uncomfortably current\" and argued that \"...you can\u2019t help but feel this is a dog eat dog world and what comes around will keep on coming around \u2013 generation to generation\".While other critics criticised the film for its lack of social context \"A middle-class couple (Rachael Blake and Tom Butcher) are terrorised in their home by a gang of youths and though the violence happens off-screen, it still feels exploitative. Williams is able to create an unsettling atmosphere with simple sound effects, but he fails to provide a convincing context for the extreme antisocial behaviour (including rape).\" \"Williams has nothing to suggest either as a possible solution to the social problem or a resolution to his drama\".\n\nTitle\nThe film\u2019s name is an ironic reminder of the address of the idealised suburban Banks family in the popular 1964 film Mary Poppins, as well as in the series of books on which the film is based.\n\nSee also\nList of films featuring home invasions\nPassage 10:\nI Was All His\nI Was All His (German: Ich war ihm h\u00f6rig) is a 1958 West German drama film directed by Wolfgang Becker and starring Barbara R\u00fctting, Carlos Thompson and Wolfgang Preiss.

It was written by Jorge Amado in 1967 and published the following year. It was later adapted to a 1977 Cinema Novo (Nouvelle Vague) film by director/screenplay writer Nelson Pereira dos Santos.\nTent of Miracles was written three years after the military overthrew Brazilian democracy, and it is part of a series Amado called \"The Bahia Novels\", works exploring the region's past.  The novel chronicles the chaos that results when a prominent Columbia University professor arrives in Brazil, with nothing but praise on his lips for a long-forgotten local Bahian writer and self-taught social scientist named Pedro Archanjo.  The year is 1968, which Levinson announces is the centennial of Archanjo's birth, setting off a media stampede to figure out who Archanjo was so that they can profit from a celebration of his life.  When a few people finally uncover who Arcanjo was and what he espoused, media barons and advertisers are horrified to discover that he was an Afro-Brazilian social critic, womanizer and heavy drinker who died penniless in the gutter.  So, they invent their own Pedro Archanjo, which they hype in various advertising-driven events, enlisting some Brazilian academics who are as superficial and self-promoting as Levinson.\nThe novel moves back and forth between events in the life of the historical hero, Pedro Archanjo, and the present.  Most of the characters are types that lend themselves to the author's relentless satire.  The historical setting is the colorful old Pelourinho neighborhood of Salvador, Bahia, that flows down the hill from the main plaza, where Archanjo works as a lowly runner at the School of Medicine adjacent to the cathedral.  The place of the title is the home of the hero and his best friend, Lidio Corro, which also serves as barber shop, cultural center, print shop and artist's studio.  The historical sections explore Afro-Brazilian culture and racial discrimination.  Author Jorge Amado once declared that \"Brazil is a racial democracy\", and the novel is consistent with that belief, because he situates all racism in the past.\nThe hero's male children are all over the city, but he is father to none.  They call him \"godfather,\" and he takes one of his \"godchildren,\" Tadeu, under his wing to help him pursue an engineering degree.  The womanizing of the hero serves to highlight the belief of both Pedro Archanjo and the novel's author that uninhibited sexual passion between people of different races and colors (and the resulting mixed children) is Brazil's unique solution to racism.  The theory behind this view was disseminated by Brazilian sociologist and historian Gilberto Freyre in his treatise Casa-Grande & Senzala (1933), translated into English as The Masters and the Slaves. A number of the female characters in the novel are highly sexualized in ways that, according to critics, represent racial stereotypes.\nIn the face of criticism of his portrayals of women and Afro-Brazilian culture, Jorge Amado declared: \"It is not a question of literary pride.  It is only the certainty that no one until today had dared to look face-to-face with so much love at Bahian humanity and its problems.  No one knows better than I, who wrote them, what the weaknesses and defects of my novels are.  But, by the same token, no one can measure the sacrifice they cost me, the honesty that went into their making, the disinterest and pure love that made the novelist return to his people.\"Beyond Amado's treatment of women and Afro-Brazilian culture, Tent of Miracles is a satire of modern Brazilian institutions, especially the mass media and parts of academia.  Spared from the author's knife is the Brazilian military, which in 1967 was detaining, torturing and exiling some of Amado's political friends.  A few scholars have suggested that the novel hides in its story a parable critical of the military dictatorship, particularly through the portrayal of a repressive but ineffectual assistant police commissioner, Pedrito Gordo.\nPassage 4:\nInstitut des hautes \u00e9tudes cin\u00e9matographiques\nL'Institut des hautes \u00e9tudes cin\u00e9matographiques (IDHEC; the \"Institute for Advanced Cinematographic Studies\") is a French film school, founded during World War II under the leadership of Marcel L'Herbier who was its president from 1944 to 1969. IDHEC offered training for directors and producers, cameramen, sound technicians, editors, art directors and costume designers. It became highly influential, and many prominent film-makers received their training there including Paulo Rocha, Louis Malle, Alain Resnais, Claire Denis, Peter Lilienthal, Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff, Andrzej \u017bu\u0142awski, Ren\u00e9 Vautier, Andre Weinfeld, Mostafa Derkaoui, Jean-Jacques Annaud, Claude Sautet, Nelson Pereira dos Santos, Patrice Leconte, Costa Gavras, Theo Angelopoulos, Omar Amiralay, Rithy Panh, Arnaud Desplechin, Claude Miller, Alfonso Gumucio Dagron Christopher Miles and Pascale Ferran.\nIt was reorganized between 1986 and 1988 and renamed La F\u00e9mis.\nPassage 5:\nNelson Pereira dos Santos\nNelson Pereira dos Santos (22 October 1928 \u2013 21 April 2018) was a Brazilian film director. He directed films such as Vidas Secas (Barren Lives), based on the book with the same name by Brazilian writer Graciliano Ramos.\n\nBiography\nPereira dos Santos, named in honor of Almirante Horatio Nelson, was born in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Himself a frequenter of the cinema, Pereira dos Santos's father brought his very young son to the movie theater for the first time. By secondary school Pereira dos Santos was already fond of literature, and at 15 years old he joined the Brazilian Communist Party and became close to one of its other members, Astrogildo Pereira. At the time the party was considered illegal by the government of Get\u00falio Vargas.\nThe first feature film he directed was Rio 40\u00b0, which was released in 1955. The film is a chronicle of life in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, and it influenced several other directors, spurring the Cinema Novo movement. In 1963, Pereira dos Santos was a member of the jury at the 3rd Moscow International Film Festival. In 1981 he was a member of the jury at the 12th Moscow International Film Festival.His most well-known film outside Brazil is Como Era Gostoso o Meu Franc\u00eas (How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman, 1971). It was entered into the 21st Berlin International Film Festival. The film takes place in the sixteenth century and details the alleged cannibalistic practices of the (now extinct) indigenous Tupinamba warrior tribe against the French and Portuguese colonizers of the Brazilian littoral.  The film is something of a black comedy about European colonialism\u2014one that makes satirical use of the Brazilian modernist trope of Antropofagia (\"cultural cannibalism\"), then recently revived by the Tropicalismo movement of the 1960s\u2014as well as a bitter commentary on the historical genocide of the indigenous tribes in Latin America and the gradual destruction of their civilization.\nHis 1994 film The Third Bank of the River was entered into the 44th Berlin International Film Festival.Pereira dos Santos' 2006 film Bras\u00edlia 18% explores some of the darker aspects of contemporary Brazilian politics such as political corruption, the murder of trial witnesses, and money laundering.\nPereira dos Santos was a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters since 2006.\n\nDeath\nPereira dos Santos died of multiple organ failure in Rio de Janeiro on 12 April 2018.

The actors and actresses who portrayed the Tupinambas wore historically correct attire resulting in  a considerable amount of historically correct nudity and semi-nudity in many scenes.\nThe location for the entire film was the Bay of Ilha Grande, which has 365 islands and whose shores comprise the Angra dos Reis and Parati municipalities in the state of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nPlot\nIn 16th century Brazil rival French and Portuguese settlers are utilizing the indigenous people as allies in their struggle to establish control. The Tupinamb\u00e1s, who live in the Guanabara Bay area, are allied with the French, while the Tupiniquins are allied with the Portuguese.\nA Frenchman who has been captured by the Portuguese is then captured by the Tupinamb\u00e1s after they attack and kill a group of Portuguese. He tries to convince his captors by speaking in French (reciting the poem by \u00c9tienne Jodelle found in Andr\u00e9 Th\u00e9vet's Singularities of France Antarctique) but the Tupinamb\u00e1s don't believe that the Frenchman was a prisoner of the Portuguese they have killed, and the Chief thinks he is Portuguese because \"No Frenchman would shoot at the Tupinamb\u00e1.\" The tribe's shaman predicted they would find a strong Portuguese man to cannibalize as revenge for the chief's brother being killed by a Portuguese musket ball. Now they have one.\nHowever, the Frenchman is allowed free run of the village area, is eventually provided with a \"wife,\" and adopts traditional Tupinamb\u00e1 nudity in place of his Western clothes. \nA French tradesman comes to the village and tells the Tupinamb\u00e1s that their prisoner is indeed Portuguese \u2013 he then promises the outraged Frenchman that he will tell the Tupinamb\u00e1s the truth if the Frenchman finds a hidden treasure that another European has hidden in the area. He also instructs him to collect wood, and pepper for him on his return.\nThe Frenchman gathers cannon powder from the abandoned Portuguese cannons, and brings it to the Tupinamb\u00e1s, who use it to defeat the rival Tupiniquins in battle.\nThe relationship between the Frenchman and his Tupinamb\u00e1 \"wife\" remains enigmatic. It is unclear for most of the movie if she intends to save him from the group that wants to eat him, or if she has been assigned to win his trust and prevent him from escaping. The Frenchman appears to become in love with her but eventually decides to try to leave. She keeps him from escaping by swamping his canoe and then shooting him in the leg with an arrow.

Bento dos Santos studied chemical-industrial engineering at the Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico (IST), Technical University of Lisbon. During his early university years he played rugby union and was also the manager of the Portugal national rugby team in 1967/1968. He started his professional career as an employee of Companhia Uni\u00e3o Fabril (CUF), the largest Portuguese business conglomerate before the Carnation Revolution in 1974. During the turmoil of the revolution, indeed a left-wing military coup, CUF was forcibly nationalized by the revolutionary government and collapsed. Bento dos Santos, together with other partners such as Eduardo Catroga, founded the metals brokerage and trading company Quimibro. In the late 1980s, Pedro Passos Coelho, future Prime Minister of Portugal, was invited by a cousin to work there as a collaborator.

Zeca, Sujinho, Jorge, Paulinho and Xerife interconnect the focused stories, covering five touristic points: Copacabana, Sugar Loaf Mountain, Corcovado, Quinta da Boa Vista and Maracan\u00e3 Stadium. In addition to trying to make a living, they decide to accumulate money to buy a soccer ball. Jorge also needs to sell enough to buy medicine for his sick mother. He goes to Copacabana, is bumped into and his can of peanuts falls into the sea. Without the goods to sell, Jorge starts begging and gets money, but other boys try to rob him, and when he gets rid of them, he is run over. Paulinho goes to Quinta da Boa Vista and his lizard, Catarina, escapes to the zoo. He retrieves it, but the guard of the place chases him away and throws his pet into a serpentarium. Resigned, Paulinho leaves for Maracan\u00e3, where he meets the rogue Miro [Jece Valad\u00e3o (1930-2006)] and his partner Z\u00e9 [Z\u00e9 K\u00e9ti (1921-1999)] who, eager to enter the stadium and watch the game, take the whole boy's money and sell the remaining peanuts. Zeca, in turn, decides to go to Corcovado, but he is noticed by the explorer of minors who works there, an unscrupulous old man who chases him, forcing him to make a risky escape. Sujinho, on the other hand, with no money and no peanuts, is escorted to his house by a policeman. Sheriff does well in sales and manages to enter Maracan\u00e3, after circumventing security. He and Zeca end the day happy to have gotten the money.\nMinor characters and other stories are told in parallel.

He started to make films while a student at the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires. At thirteen years old, he made his first short film, based on the short story Continuity of the Parks by Julio Cort\u00e1zar. After graduation from high school, he started studying psychology, before dropping out in favor of enrolling in the National Institute of Cinema and Audiovisual Arts's film school. He graduated in 1983 with a short film called La espera, based on a story by Jorge Luis Borges. The short earned him a prize at the Huesca International Film Festival in Spain.Bielinsky entered the film industry around 1983 as an assistant director, working under such filmmakers as Miguel P\u00e9rez, Carlos Soria and Eliseo Subiela. He also worked on a M\u00e9gane commercial that Wim Wenders was filming in Argentina. Bielinsky wrote the script for the 1998 film La son\u00e1mbula, recuerdos del futuro (released abroad as Sleepwalker), directed by Fernando Spiner.Bielinsky directed his first film, Nine Queens (Spanish: Nueve reinas) in 2000, a crime thriller about a scam involving forged stamps. The film was critically acclaimed both in Argentina and abroad, and earned seven Silver Condor awards, including Best Film, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. Bielinsky was asked by several Hollywood companies to remake the film in English, but declined. An American remake, Criminal, was produced by Steven Soderbergh and released in 2004.\nBielinsky directed his second film, The Aura, in 2005. Ricardo Dar\u00edn, who played the lead in Nine Queens, also played the lead role in The Aura. While less financially successful that Nine Queens, it received critical praise. Critics noted how The Aura dropped many of the black comedy elements of Nine Queens in favor of a more atmospheric and cerebral noir. The film won Best Film, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay at the Silver Condor awards. The film was the Argentine entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 78th Academy Awards.\nIn both of his films various characters mention \"El Turco\", a powerful underworld figure who is never shown on screen.\n\nPersonal life and legacy\nBielinsky was married and had one child. A month before Bielinsky was going to present The Aura at the Edinburgh International Film Festival, he died from a heart attack in his sleep in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, while casting for an advertisement.In 2011, he was posthumously awarded a Konex Award as one of the 5 best film directors of the decade in Argentina.", "answers": ["yes"], "incorrect_answer": "No."}, {"input": "Who has more scope of profession, B.

Tom Mix was still an A-list star in 1935, alongside Charles Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. and Mary Pickford.  He was paid $40,000 for four weeks work on The Miracle Rider, which he used as urgent funding to support his circus.The serial combined the large cast and interlocking plots of a silent serial with the science fiction and cliffhangers of the sound era. Filming of the outdoor action sequences took place primarily at the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, Calif., on the outskirts of Los Angeles. The movie ranch, which had been in use as a filming location since the early silent movie era, was known for its rugged landscape and giant sandstone boulders. One of those boulders became known as Tom Mix Rock in later years, after it was discovered that bootholes had been carved in the rock to help the actor shoot a scene atop the rock for The Miracle Rider.\n\nStunts\nTom Mix, whose voice was strained and nasal due to a repeatedly broken nose and a bullet through his throat, did a lot of his own stunts, although some were doubled by Cliff Lyons.\n\nChapter titles\nThe Vanishing Indian\nThe Firebird Strikes\nThe Flying Knife\nA Race with Death\nDouble Barreled Doom\nThundering Hoofs [sic]\nThe Dragnet\nGuerilla Warfare\nThe Silver Road\nSignal Fires\nA Traitor Dies\nDanger Rides with Death\nThe Secret of X-94\nBetween Two Fires\nJustice Rides the PlainsSource:This was Mascot's only 15-chapter serial.\n\"Zaroff\" is obviously inspired by Basil Zaharoff, a notorious early twentieth-century arms merchant, often cited as one of the so-called \"merchants of death\", who supposedly helped bring on World War I.\n\nSee also\nList of film serials\nList of film serials by studio\nPassage 6:\nPrairie Thunder\nPrairie Thunder is a 1937 American Western film directed by B.

Joan is courting Rod Farrell, a scout for the Union Army. Rod is ordered to investigate a break in the telegraph line, along with sidekick, Wichita, a Union soldier. Rod finds the break in the line in Indian territory and repairs it. Rod suspects a white man assisted the local Indian tribe in sabotaging the line. Rod and Wichita ride up on an Indian camp. The Indian chief, High Wolf, tells Rod the Indians intend to make war because the railroad and the telegraph coming to the region have depleted the buffalo population. High Wolf confirms a white man, who he will not name, is the only friend to his tribe. Rod and Wichita discover a man named Lynch and his gang are supplying the Indians with weapons and ammunition in exchange for the Indians hijacking supply trains. Rod and Wichita breach the gang's hideout, take Lynch and his gang into custody, hold them at Temple's store, and telegraph the cavalry for help. Rod rides off with Joan while Wichita guards the gang.

Reeves Eason, was an American film director, actor and screenwriter. His directorial output was limited mainly to low-budget westerns and action pictures, but it was as a second-unit director and action specialist that he was best known. He was famous for staging spectacular battle scenes in war films and action scenes in large-budget westerns, but he acquired the nickname \"Breezy\" for his \"breezy\" attitude towards safety while staging his sequences\u2014during the famous cavalry charge at the end of Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), so many horses were killed or injured so severely that they had to be euthanized that both the public and Hollywood itself were outraged, resulting in the selection of the American Humane Society by the beleaguered studios to provide representatives on the sets of all films using animals to ensure their safety.\n\nCareer\nBorn in Massachusetts, Eason studied engineering at the University of California. Eason directed 150 films and starred in almost 100 films over his career. Eason's career transcended into sound and he directed film serials such as The Miracle Rider starring Tom Mix in 1935. He used 42 cameras to film the chariot race as a second-unit director on Ben-Hur (1925), the climactic charge in Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), and also directed the \"Burning of Atlanta\" in Gone with the Wind (1939).\n\nFamily and personal life\nHis son, B.

It is native to Costa Rica and northern and western South America (Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Guyana). Under the synonym Polypodium rimbachii, it was regarded as endemic to Ecuador and threatened by habitat loss.\nPassage 2:\nPhlebodium aureum\nPhlebodium aureum (golden polypody, golden serpent fern, cabbage palm fern, gold-foot fern, blue-star fern, hare-foot fern; syn. Polypodium aureum, Polypodium leucotomos) is an epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.\n\nDescription\nIt is a rhizomatous fern, with the creeping rhizome 8\u201315 mm (rarely 30 mm) in diameter, densely covered in the golden-brown scales that give the species its name. The fronds are large and pinnatifid (deeply lobed), from 30\u2013130 cm long and 10\u201350 cm broad, with up to 35 pinnae; they vary in color from bright green to glaucous green and have undulate margins. Several round sori run along each side of the pinna midrib, and the minute spores are wind-dispersed. The fronds are evergreen in areas with year-round rainfall, semi-evergreen or briefly deciduous in areas with a marked dry season.\n\nDistribution\nIt is confined to the eastern side of the Americas and the Caribbean, ranging from the extreme southeast of the  US state of Georgia and south into Florida. It is also found in the Bahamas, on Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and the Lesser Antilles, as well as coastal regions of Caribbean and Atlantic South America, including Venezuela, Brazil, Suriname, French Guinea, Guyana, and Paraguay. It is the only species of Phlebodium found in North America or on Caribbean islands; all other species are endemic to South America.\n\nHabitat\nThis fern is rarely terrestrial in habitat, usually colonizing the canopies of tropical rainforests and the dwarf palms of subtropical forests. It is common in the cloud forests of the Caribbean and northern South America. It grows in varied habitats in Florida, including swamps and hammocks, and can thus apparently tolerate a wide range of microclimates. Its restriction to the tropics and subtropics is readily explained by its intolerance of anything other than very brief, light frosts. High levels of light are also critical for the growth of this species, and its deciduous habit allows it to invade relatively dry areas.\n\nCultivation and uses\nPhlebodium aureum is well-adapted to cultivation and is valued both as an ornamental plant and in herbal medicine.\nIt can be cultivated in greenhouses in non-tropical climates if night temperatures do not fall below about 5 \u00b0C. Several cultivars have been selected for garden planting, with varying leaf color from grey-green to silver-green to blue-green, or with cristate or very wavy frond margins.\n\nMedicine\nDecoctions have been used as a panacea in Central American folk medicine. These tonics were prescribed for a multitude of ailments, ranging from asthma to heart disease. Modern medicine has also investigated P. aureum, often using the deprecated synonym Polypodium leucotomos.\nOral consumption of Polypodium leucotomos extract has also been studied for the treatment of dermatologic disorders including melasma, vitiligo, psoriasis, polymorphous light eruption, atopic dermatitis, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, photoaging and skin cancer.Oral consumption of Polypodium leucotomos extract has been shown to protect the skin from ultraviolet light damage. Clinical studies have shown that Polypodium leucotomos extract provides photoprotection against the effects of both UVB and UVA light. A review of 19 human and 6 basic scientific studies showed that Polypodium leucotomos was well tolerated with a favorable side effect profile. Consequently, Polypodium leucotomos supplementation has been posited as an adjunct photoprotection strategy in combination with traditional UV filters, such as sunscreen.\n\nSystematics\nPhlebodium aureum is a member of a very small, and recently discovered genus. It was split from the genus Polypodium, and the split is still apparent in the multitude of synonyms available for Phlebodium aureum. Phlebodium is one of the 178 genera in the family Polypodiaceae. Additionally, the family Polypodiaceae is broken into a number of subfamilies, with Phlebodium a member of the non-grammatid tribe within the subfamily Polypodioideae. Members of the non-grammatids in this subfamily include the genera Phlebodium as well as Polypodium, from which Phlebodium is derived and which most likely is its closest relative. Other members include Pecluma, Pleopeltis, Microgramma, and Pleurosoriopsis. A bootstrapping technique proves that, at a 90% confidence level, the polypodiaceous ferns form a sister relationship with tree ferns. However, further phylogenetic studies need to be conducted regarding the current status of the genus, and which of the species are the most related.\nThe genus Phlebodium is exemplified by containing rows of areoles that lack included veins, and each sorus served by two different veins. Correll and Correll, two authors responsible for thirty years of classification since Flora was introduced in 1982, documented Phlebodium aureum as Polypodium aureum as recently as 1982. However, this creation of the new genera is warranted based on some notable differences. For instance, Giudice et al. point out that the sori on Phlebodium are more smooth and rounded when compared to other groups within the family Polypodiaceae. Additionally, studies on spores and size of the mature plant prove that Phlebodium contrasts severely from the rest of its family, providing the creation of the genera. The division of genera within the Polypodiaceae is fairly gray, considering that systematically, gametophytes differ only very slightly amongst different genera.\nMembers of the family Polypodiaceae are most closely related to the Davalliaceae, with further relationships noted to Oleandraceae, Tectariaceae, and the Lomariopsidaceae within the order Polypodiales, which contains 80% of today\u2019s ferns species (see additional page for picture). The order arose and diversified about 100 million years ago, and are regarded as one of the most evolutionarily advanced orders of ferns.\nPassage 3:\nPolypodium scutulatum\nSerpocaulon fraxinifolium is a species of fern in the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to Mexico, Central and South America. Under the synonym Polypodium scutulatum , it was regarded as endemic to Ecuador and threatened by habitat loss.\nPassage 4:\nPolypodium australe\nPolypodium cambricum, the southern polypody, limestone polypody, or Welsh polypody, is a species of fern in the family Polypodiaceae, native to southern and western Europe where it grows on shady rocks, near the coasts of the Mediterranean Basin and in the mountains of Atlantic Europe. It is a spreading, terrestrial, deciduous fern growing to 60 centimetres (24 in) tall, with pinnate fronds. The sori are yellow in winter.\n\nDescription\nPerennial. Rhizome elongate, often above ground, densely covered with rusty scales. Fronds distich, 5\u201330 centimetres (2.0\u201311.8 in), glabrous, deltoid in outline; petiole yellowish green, shorter than the pinnatipartite limb. Segments 5-28 on each side; margin dentate, marked with a strong midrib. Sori round, 2\u20134 millimetres (0.079\u20130.157 in) in diameter, orange-yellow, arranged on each side of the midrib of segments. The fruits bloom from February to July.\n\nName\nThis species has been widely known by the more apt name P. australe F\u00e9e. However, since Linnaeus did mention the species, albeit in the aberrant cambricum-form, that name must have priority.\n\nEtymology\nPolypodium is derived from the Greek Polus, many, and podion, small foot, since the rhizome bears numerous roots. \nThe specific epithet cambricum means \"Welsh\", from the Latinized form of Cymru, the Welsh name for Wales. \nAustrale comes from the Latin auter, wind of the south, for in Europe, this species grows largely in the Mediterranean Basin.\n\nCultivation\nTwo cultivars have received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:\n\n'Cambricum' \n'Grandiceps Fox' (Cristatum Group)\nPassage 5:\nPleopeltis polypodioides\nPleopeltis polypodioides (syn. Polypodium polypodioides), also known as the resurrection fern, is a species of creeping, coarse-textured fern native to the Americas and Africa.\n\nDescription\nThe evergreen fronds of this fern are 25 cm high by 5 cm wide and monomorphic. The leathery, yellow-green pinnae (leaflets) are deeply pinnatifid, oblong to narrowly lanceolate, usually widest near middle, occasionally at or near base. It attaches to the limbs of its host plant with a branching, creeping, slender rhizome, which grows to 2 mm in diameter. The scales are lanceolate, with light brown base and margins, and having a dark central stripe.\n\nThe gametophytes (the haploid gamete producers) of this plant develop from very small spores that float in the air and are deposited on moist tree branches. These spores are produced in sporangia that develop on the leaves of the fern's sporophyte. The fern can also reproduce by the division of its rhizomes.\nOn the underside of the blades, the sori (reproductive clusters) are round, discrete, and sunken. Their outline can be seen as raised dimples on the upper surface. They are typically near the outer edge, and occur on all but the lowest pinnae of fertile fronds. Indusium is absent. Sporangia are yellow to brown at maturity. Spores are produced from summer to fall.\n\nHabitat\nThis fern is an epiphyte, or air plant, which means it attaches itself to other plants and gets its nutrients from the air and from water and nutrients that collect on the outer surface of bark. The resurrection fern lives on the branches of large trees such as cypresses and can often be seen carpeting the shady areas on limbs of large oak trees repeatedly exposed to rainfall. However, it is known to grow on the surfaces of rocks and dead logs as well. It is often found in the company of other epiphytic plants such as Spanish moss.\nThe P. polypodioides resides in the hardwood forests of southeastern United States in areas including Delaware, Maryland, the Carolinas, Virginia, West Virginia, Illinois, Ohio, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Arkansas, Texas and Oklahoma. This fern can also be found in areas such as subtropical America, parts of southern Africa and other humid or sub-humid climate areas.\n\nPhysiology and Rehydration\nThe resurrection fern gets its name because it can survive long periods of drought by curling up its fronds and appearing desiccated, grey-brown and dead. However, when just a little water is present, the fern will uncurl and reopen, appearing to \"resurrect\". It has been estimated that these plants could last 100 years without water and still revive after a single exposure.\n\nThe resurrection fern roots have evolved to function as anchors for the epiphytes, holding them to their host tree\u2019s bark and have been found to be inefficient in absorption. When in clustered groups of ferns on the bark of trees, the increased transpiration of the ferns and bark allow the middle ferns of the cluster to remain open longer than ferns on the outside. The relative humidity of the air and the closing rate of the leaves of the ferns is an inverse relationship. The greater the humidity, the slower the leaves of the ferns close because they have prolonged exposure to moisture in the air.The resurrection fern can severely desiccate and lose almost all of its water. Experiments have shown they can lose up to 97%--and remain alive, though more typically they only lose around 76% in dry spells. For comparison, most other plants would die after losing only 8-12%. This fern can lose almost all the water not hydrating the cells in its leaves and survive. Upon rainfall or even minute exposures to water they can fully rehydrate and return to a normal state within 24 to 48 hours. Following substantial exposures to moisture, there is an immediate increase in its water content of up to 50% after the first hour and 65-70% after three hours. When it regains moisture, the fern can once again become photosynthetically active, increasing its metabolism and release of organic compounds that provide nutrients for symbiotic bacteria that allow them both to thrive.  \n\nAt least one study has shown association between P. polypodioides and moss, indicating that this fern may rely on moss for some of its water needs.\nThe resurrection ferns accumulate sugar in their dehydrated cells in order to protect them and stabilize the membranes and proteins in the dry state. By accumulating sugar, the cells can maintain hydrogen bonds between necessary macromolecules needed for their structure. An interesting feature of the resurrection fern is it does not immediately uptake water after having been in a desiccated state. The resurrection ferns have porous cell structure networks that can expand and rearrange to accommodate absorbing three to four times their own weight in water after being exposed. Initially, the water flows via capillary pressure into the spongy layer of the epidermis and the porous network of the fern\u2019s leaves, without altering them significantly. Over time, pressure builds up in the fern cell network, changing the turgor pressure and strain in the plant, initiating the unfolding of the leaves. The fern only stops unfolding its leaves when the cell network of the fern is entirely filled with water. The uncurling of the leaves was believed to be an entirely osmotic phenomenon, but when the fern is again exposed to water, it absorbs the water through solid colloids causing an increase in volume and capillary pressure of the cells of the fern.\n\nWhen the fronds \"dry\", they curl with their bottom sides upwards. In this way, they can rehydrate the quickest when rain comes, as most of the water is absorbed on the underside of the leaf blades. The fern fronds contain canal cells in the center of their surface scales that direct water to the epidermis of the fern leaves, allowing absorption. The ability of the fern fronds to unroll after exposure to desiccation is attributed to the large cells of the upper epidermis along the midrib of the frond that increase in width more than any other epidermal cell, which forces the fronds to uncurl and flatten out.One way the resurrection fern has adapted to survive desiccation is the ability of its cell walls to deform and reform, without bursting or rupturing. It has been observed that dehydrins may allow the cell walls of the fern fronds and leaves to deform and reform in times of extreme drought followed by water exposure, due to large fluctuations in water content. Dehydrins were found to be only expressed when the fern was drying or in the desiccated state, with the dehydrins located on the outsides of the cells near the cell walls, allowing the leaves and fronds of the ferns to deform and reform accordingly.Thermoluminescence of the resurrection fern has been tested to observe at what temperatures it occurs and therefore shows what temperatures and amount of desiccation the ferns can tolerate before their chloroplasts lose the energy they\u2019ve stored for the plant, in the form of light emissions. One study found the resurrection fern to require high temperatures before thermoluminescence occurred at around 50 degrees C whereas other desiccation-tolerant plants showed thermoluminescence at 40 degrees C. The thermoluminescence activity of the resurrection fern increased as it was exposed to six separate but consecutive flashes of green safelight at its leaves. Because thermoluminescence from the fern fronds wasn\u2019t observed until higher temperatures, this hints that the fern\u2019s chloroplasts may have a mechanism to withhold and store energy for the fern as it desiccates that allow it to survive higher temperatures and extreme periods of desiccation.\n\nReproduction\nThe fern has spores on the bottom of the fronds, contained in sori. The fern sporulates in Summer and early Fall. Rhizome sections are also viable offspring and can root themselves in new medium.\n\nSee also\nResurrection plant\nPassage 6:\nPolypodium\nPolypodium is a genus of ferns in the family Polypodiaceae, subfamily Polypodioideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). The genus is widely distributed throughout the world, with the highest species diversity in the tropics. The name is derived from Ancient Greek poly (\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd) \"many\" + podion (\u03c0\u03cc\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd) \"little foot\", on account of the foot-like appearance of the rhizome and its branches. They are commonly called polypodies or rockcap ferns, but for many species unique vernacular names exist.\nThey are terrestrial or epiphytic ferns, with a creeping, densely hairy or scaly rhizome bearing fronds at intervals along its length. The species differ in size and general appearance and in the character of the fronds, which are evergreen, persisting for 1\u20132 years, pinnate or pinnatifid (rarely simple entire), and from 10\u201380 cm or more long. The sori or groups of spore-cases (sporangia) are borne on the back of the frond; they are globose and naked, not covered with a membrane (indusium).\nPolypodies have some use in herbalism, but are today most important in horticulture where several species, hybrids, and their cultivars like Polypodium 'Green Wave' are commonly used as ornamental plants for shady locations. Polypodium have a bitter-sweet taste and are among the rather few ferns that are used in cooking; in this case as a spice e.g. for nougat.\n\nSpecies\nSeveral of the species form hybrids with other species in the genus; these may often be distinguished by being sterile, with very small \"blind\" sori. As of February 2020, Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World accepted the following species and hybrids:\n\nA number of species formerly included in the genus have recently been transferred to other genera, including Campyloneurum, Cyathea, Microgramma, Nephrolepis, Pecluma, Phlebodium, Pleopeltis and Serpocaulon. Species placed elsewhere include:\n\nPolypodium argyrolepis = Serpocaulon lasiopus\nPolypodium mindense = Serpocaulon eleutherophlebium\nPolypodium mixtum = Pleopeltis murora\nPolypodium piligerum = Moranopteris achilleifolia\nPolypodium punctatum Thunb. ex Murray = Hypolepis punctata\nPolypodium quitense = Pecluma dulcis\nPolypodium rimbachii = Serpocaulon sessilifolium\nPolypodium scutulatum = Serpocaulon fraxinifolium\nPassage 7:\nPolypodium cambricum\nPolypodium cambricum, the southern polypody, limestone polypody, or Welsh polypody, is a species of fern in the family Polypodiaceae, native to southern and western Europe where it grows on shady rocks, near the coasts of the Mediterranean Basin and in the mountains of Atlantic Europe.

Sometimes called the Appalachian polypody or Appalachian rockcap fern, it is very similar in appearance to Polypodium virginianum.  For years, P. virginianum\u2014long considered a variety of the British Polypodium vulgare\u2014was recognized as having cryptic races, with diploid, triploid, and tetraploid representatives.  Since the triploid specimens bore abortive spores, it was apparently the hybrid between the diploid and tetraploid groups.  In 1991, it was resolved that the type of P. virginianum was the tetraploid series, and that it is an allotetraploid species of hybrid origin, with the diploid species as one parent.  The diploid species was then named P. appalachianum.  The other parent of P. virginianum was found to be Polypodium sibiricum.  The tetraploid of hybrid derivation tolerates warmer climates than either parent.\n\nPolypodium sibiricum is also now known to be one of the parents of the allotetraploid Polypodium vulgare, along with Polypodium glycyrrhiza.P. appalachianum is an epipetric plant, preferring sandstone or other hard, noncalcareous rocks.  However, it is known to grow as an epiphyte in the Smoky Mountains. Throughout much of its range, it will be found to grow in places more sheltered from the sun and heat than is P. virginianum. Both species, and their hybrid, can form large clonal colonies, forming dense mats that hold organic matter in place on rock shelves and surfaces.\nPassage 9:\nPhlebodium\nPhlebodium is a small genus of ferns in the family Polypodiaceae, subfamily Polypodioideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Its species were formerly included in Polypodium.They are epiphytic ferns, with a creeping, densely hairy or scaly rhizome bearing fronds at intervals along its length. The fronds are evergreen, persisting for 1\u20132 years, and are pinnatifid. The sori or groups of spore-cases (sporangia) are borne on the back of the frond.\n\nSpecies\nAs of February 2020, Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World accepted the following species:\n\nSee also\nCalaguala\nPassage 10:\nAichryson\nAichryson is a genus of about 15 species of succulent, subtropical plants, mostly native to the Canary Islands, with a few in the Azores, Madeira and Morocco.\nThe species of Aichryson are not frost-resistant. They are related to Sempervivum, Jovibarba, Greenovia, Aeonium and Monanthes, readily seen in their similar flowers.\nThe genus name comes from a contraction of the Greek \"aei\" (always) and \"chrysos\" (gold).Several species are cultivated as ornamental plants. The hybrid cultivar Aichryson \u00d7 aizoides var. domesticum 'Variegatum' is a recipient of the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\nTaxonomy\nRecent phylogenetic studies of Crassulaceae indicate that Aichryson is closely related to Monanthes and Aeonium (both genera are also largely endemic to the Canary Islands). Two other genera of Crassulaceae that have many-parted (polymerous) flowers (Sempervivum and Jovibarba) are not closely related to the three Canary Island genera.On the Canary Islands, the center of species diversity seems to be the island of La Palma.\nRelationships within Aichryson were investigated by Fairfield et al. (2004) [Plant Systematics and Evolution 248: 71\u201383].

It was released as the album's first single on July 5, 2001, through MCA Nashville. The song garnered a positive reception from contemporary music critics, who found McEntire fitting to perform the song. The track experienced moderate success in the United States, where it peaked at No. 49 on the Billboard Hot 100 as well as No. 3 on the Billboard' Hot Country Songs. An altered version of the song was later used as the theme song for McEntire's The WB sitcom Reba (2001).\n\nBackground and composition\n\"I'm a Survivor\" was written by Shelby Kennedy and Philip White. It was produced by McEntire and record producer Tony Brown. The song features a variety of instrumentation, including electric guitars, played by Steve Gibson.

He is best known for his role as Ray Barone on the CBS sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond, for which he received an Emmy Award, and as the voice of Manny in the Ice Age film series. He created and starred in the TNT comedy drama Men of a Certain Age (2009\u20132011). From 2012 to 2015, Romano had a recurring role as Hank Rizzoli, a love interest of Sarah Braverman in the NBC series Parenthood. More recently, he co-starred in the romantic comedy The Big Sick (2017) and portrayed mob lawyer Bill Bufalino in Martin Scorsese's epic crime film The Irishman (2019). Since 2017, Romano has portrayed Rick Moreweather in the Epix comedy-drama series Get Shorty.\n\nEarly life and education\nRomano was born in Queens, New York City, the second son of Luciana \"Lucie\" (n\u00e9e Fortini), a piano teacher, and Albert Romano (1925\u20132010), a real estate agent and engineer. He is of Italian descent. He grew up in the Forest Hills neighborhood of Queens. He has an older brother, Richard (born 1956), a sergeant with the NYPD, and a younger brother, Robert (born c. 1966), a second grade teacher in New York City.Romano attended elementary and middle school at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs in Forest Hills. After transferring from Archbishop Molloy High School, Romano graduated from Hillcrest High School in 1975. He was in the same high school class as Fran Drescher. Before getting into show business, Romano briefly attended Queens College, in Flushing, New York, where he studied accounting.\n\nCareer\nHis early comedy career started when he competed in the Johnnie Walker Comedy Search in 1989 directed by Saturday Night Live short film producer Neal Marshad and appeared on The Comedy Channel. His career included many outlets, such as Comedy Central, where he had been a recurring guest voice on the show Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist. He also was a contestant on Star Search in the stand-up comedy category. He originally was cast to play Joe (originally named Rick) on the American television sitcom NewsRadio, but was fired and replaced by Joe Rogan. He then appeared on Late Show with David Letterman doing his stand up routine which formed his ties with CBS. Shortly thereafter, he became the star of his own show, Everybody Loves Raymond on CBS, that featured a cast and format more suitable to Romano's brand of humor. His work on the series earned him six Primetime Emmy Award nominations as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, a category he won in 2002. He also shared two Emmy Awards as an executive producer when his show won as Outstanding Comedy Series in 2003 and 2005.Romano performed the opening monologue at the 1998 White House Correspondents' Association dinner.Romano and his comedian friend Kevin James starred in the salesman comedy Grilled as two average Joes of the same profession who are both desperate to land a big sale.\nRomano was featured on a 2000 episode of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, on which he won $125,000 for the NYPD's D.A.R.E. unit. The following year, he and one of his brothers appeared on a New York Police Department recruiting poster.In 2004, Romano became the highest-paid television actor in history for his role of Raymond on CBS's Everybody Loves Raymond. The show broke another record by having the highest revenue, at $3.9 billion.On December 13, 2003, Romano was a guest star, sending a birthday card to Bob Barker for Barker's 80th birthday on the 27th \"Million Dollar Spectacular\" special of the CBS game show The Price Is Right.Romano was the subject of the documentary film 95 Miles to Go. The film documents Romano's road trip for a series of rides across the south of the United States. The film was released in theaters on April 7, 2010, by ThinkFilm. In August 2006 Romano was interviewed in front of a live audience at UCLA by fellow stand-up veteran David Steinberg, for an episode of Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg. The program first aired on the TV Land network in March 2007.\nRomano returned to television with a new dramedy for TNT in 2008, Men of a Certain Age, which he co-created with former Everybody Loves Raymond writer Mike Royce. It co-starred Scott Bakula and Andre Braugher.\nRomano made an appearance in the seventh season of NBC series The Office as Merv Bronte, a nervous job applicant interviewing for the job left vacant by Michael Scott.Romano made an appearance in the third-season premiere of ABC sitcom The Middle as Nicky, a friend of Mike, who ruined his and Frankie's honeymoon. Romano was the second actor from Everybody Loves Raymond to be reunited with Patricia Heaton on The Middle. Doris Roberts guest-starred in three episodes.\nHe joined the cast of Parenthood beginning with its fourth season premiere. He became a semi-regular, playing photographer Hank Rizzoli, who hired and later had a romantic relationship with Sarah Braverman and developed a friendship with her nephew who has Asperger syndrome. The role was specifically created for him after he expressed his love for the series and met with creator Jason Katims on the set of Friday Night Lights.In 2002, Romano voiced the woolly mammoth Manfred (Manny) in the film Ice Age, and its sequels Ice Age: The Meltdown in 2006, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs in 2009, Ice Age: Continental Drift in 2012, and Ice Age: Collision Course in 2016.\nFrom 2017 to 2019, Romano played a leading role in three seasons of the MGM+ television show Get Shorty, created by Davey Holmes and co-starring Chris O'Dowd.In 2019, Romano starred in the Netflix comedy film Paddleton and portrayed mob lawyer Bill Bufalino in Martin Scorsese's The Irishman.Romano is set to play Jim Valvano in an upcoming movie about the former NC State Wolfpack basketball coach.\n\nCompetitions\nRomano competed in the World Series of Poker in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015.\nIn early 2010, Romano starred in the second season of The Golf Channel's original series The Haney Project in which Tiger Woods' former coach Hank Haney attempts to improve the golf games of different celebrities and athletes. Romano's goal was to finish the show being able to break 80.  Romano took time off from the show to be with his father, Albert Romano, who died in March 2010. Romano is also a regular competitor in the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, where he finished fifth in 2012 with his partner, Australian professional Steven Bowditch. It was the first time Romano had qualified for the final round after failing to do so on 11 successive occasions. He also competes annually in the American Century Championship, a celebrity golf tournament owned by NBC and held at Lake Tahoe each July.\n\nPersonal life\nRomano married his wife, Anna Scarpulla, in 1987. They met while working at a bank together. Romano's character's daughter on Everybody Loves Raymond was named after his real-life daughter, Alexandra \"Ally\" Romano. Also, in the series pilot, Ray and Debra's twin boys were named Gregory and Matthew, after Romano's real-life twin sons, but Romano felt it was inconvenient to have all his television children have the same names as his real children and changed the twins' names to Geoffrey and Michael onscreen. He also said his brother was not pleased with Ray Barone's television brother.Romano's family has made various appearances in the show. Romano's daughter made several appearances on Everybody Loves Raymond as Molly, the best friend of his on-screen daughter, Ally, and the daughter of Ray Barone's nemesis, Peggy the Cookie Lady. Romano's father, Albert Romano, has made various appearances as Albert, one of Frank Barone's lodge buddies in various episodes, such as \"Debra at the Lodge\", and \"Boys' Therapy\". Romano's brother, Richard Romano, appeared in the episodes \"Golf For It\", \"Just a Formality\", and \"The Toaster\". Romano's wife, Anna, appeared as one of the moms in the background at Geoffrey and Michael's school in season 6's episode titled \"The Angry Family\".In February 2012, Romano revealed that his wife, Anna, had successfully battled stage one breast cancer in 2010. Romano told People magazine that \"the reason we're going public is to share our experience, yeah, but to have an effect. Our goal is to help people.\"Romano was close friends with Doris Roberts, who played Marie Barone, Ray Barone's mother, on Everybody Loves Raymond. At the time of her death, Romano said he was inspired by her desire to continue learning throughout her life. She also served as a mentor, helping him to feel more comfortable on set.\n\nFilmography\nFilm\nTelevision\nVideo games\nWriting credits\nEverybody Loves Raymond\nIn addition to his roles as star and producer of Everybody Loves Raymond, Romano also co-wrote the following episodes:\n\nSeason one\"Why Are We Here?\" (with Tom Paris)Season two\"Golf\" (with Tom Caltabiano and Kevin James)\n\"The Wedding\" (with Philip Rosenthal)Season three\"Ray Home Alone\" (with Tucker Cawley)\n\"How They Met\" (with Philip Rosenthal)Season four\"Debra's Workout\" (with Tom Caltabiano and Mike Royce)\n\"Bad Moon Rising\" (with Philip Rosenthal)Season five\"Super Bowl\" (with Mike Royce)Season six\"Jealous Robert\" (with Tom Caltabiano)\n\"Talk to Your Daughter\" (with Tucker Cawley)\n\"The First Time\" (with Tom Caltabiano and Mike Royce)Season seven\"She's the One\" (with Philip Rosenthal)\n\"The Bachelor Party\" (with Mike Royce and Tom Caltabiano)Season nine\"Angry Sex\" (with Lew Schneider and Mike Scully)\n\nMen of a Certain Age\nSeason one\"Pilot\" (with Mike Royce)\n\"Let It Go\" (with Mike Royce)\n\"Back in the Shit\" (teleplay) with Mike RoyceSeason two\"If I Could, I Surely Would\" (with Mike Royce)\n\nDiscography\nLive at Carnegie Hall (2001, Columbia) - CD\n\nBibliography\nEverything and a Kite (non-fiction) (1999)\nRaymie, Dickie and the Bean (children's) (2005)\nEverybody Loves Raymond: Our Family Album (2004)\n\nAwards and nominations\nPassage 5:\nThe Last One to Know (song)\n\"The Last One to Know\" is a song written by Matraca Berg and Jane Mariash, and recorded by American country music artist Reba McEntire.

He directed nearly 100 films between 1926 and 1967, notably 27 features and shorts with Leon Errol, including the Mexican Spitfire series. His 1936 film Dummy Ache was nominated for an Academy Award in 1936 for Best Short Subject (Two-Reel).  Dummy Ache was preserved by the Academy Film Archive and the Library of Congress in 2013. His 1937 film Should Wives Work? (starring Errol) was also nominated for an Academy Award in the same category. He was born in London, England and he died in Hollywood, California.\nGoodwins began his screen career in the waning years of silent films, as a gag writer and then director. He directed comedy stars Snub Pollard and Ben Turpin for the low-budget Weiss Brothers studio. In 1936 producer Maurice Conn hired Goodwins to direct features for Ambassador Pictures starring Pinky Tomlin or Frankie Darro. That same year he joined the two-reel comedy unit at RKO Radio Pictures, two of his early efforts earning Academy Award nominations. Goodwins became a fixture at RKO, equally adept at action and mystery stories but specializing in comedy. He remained with the short-subject division while working on feature films, notably the popular Mexican Spitfire comedies. He remained with RKO through 1951.\nIn 1950 Goodwins entered the new field of television, directing Jackie Gleason in The Life of Riley. The director's long experience with budget productions made him an ideal choice for fast-paced television production, and he was involved in several hit shows including Topper, The Cisco Kid, My Favorite Martian, F Troop, and Gilligan's Island.\n\nPartial filmography\nPassage 2:\nShould Wives Work?\nShould Wives Work? is a 1937 American short comedy film directed by Leslie Goodwins.

Roberts and Charles R. Marion, based upon the successful radio program Lum and Abner created by Chester Lauck and Norris Goff.  It was the fifth of seven films in the Lum and Abner series, and was released by RKO Radio Pictures on September 28, 1944.  The film stars Lauck and Goff, along with Florence Lake and Andrew Tombes.\n\nPlot\nLum Edwards and Abner Peabody own a general store in Pine Ridge. When oil tycoon M. A. Parker is stranded in the town awaiting his car being repaired, he decides to play a practical joke on the two small-town rubes, and feigns interest in purchasing their store, alleging that there is an oil deposit below the premises. He offers Lum and Abner $20,000 for their property, but the two believe he is trying to steal their property by offering them far less than the property is truly worth. Rather than take Parker's money, the pair convince their friends and neighbors to donate money to drill for oil.\nAs the days go by and they do not strike oil, Lum and Abner get their fellow citizens to invest more and more funds. Eventually, however, there comes a day when their oil speculation company runs out of money. Desperate to get their investors' money back, the pair head to Chicago to sell their property to Parker. While waiting to see him, the duo is overheard discussing their oil property by Jimmy Benton, who works for Parker's chief rival. He approaches Lum and Abner and offers them a large sum of money for their property, enough to pay back all their investors. Parker's partner, Clarke, overhears Benton's offer, and not wanting to lose out on such a lucrative prospect, offers the pair even more money. Lum and Abner agree to sell to Clarke, and return to Pine Ridge, able to pay back all their investors with interest, as well as making a tidy profit for themselves. Parker and Clarke, meanwhile, are left with a worthless piece of property.\n\nCast\n(cast list as per AFI database)\nChester Lauck as Lum Edwards\nNorris Goff as Abner Peabody\nBarbara Hale as Sally\nFlorence Lake as Abigail\nGrady Sutton as Cedric\nDick Elliott as Squire\nHerbert Rawlinson as Wentworth\nDick Baldwin as Jimmy Benton\nErnie Adams as Zeke\nJack Rice as Clarke\nSam Flint as Dr. Crane\nAndrew Tombes as  M.

The film was slated to be one of five RKO productions to be screened at New York City tradeshows from September 18\u201322.\n\nReception\nThe Film Daily found little merit with the film, feeling that it would only appeal to fans of the radio program. They called the production quality \"routine\", and the direction of Leslie Goodwins, \"pedestrian\". Harrison's Reports also gave the picture a lukewarm review, echoing the sentiment that it would only find an audience among the existing fans of the Lum and Abner radio show. Motion Picture Daily was more kind. While they agreed that the film's comedy would find the best reception among the radio show's audience, they felt that it would have a broader appeal, saying that the picture made \"...no passes at subtlety or finesse and concentrates on characterization and the broad sweep of rustic humor.

Based on a story by John Twist, with a screenplay by novelist Nathanael West, the film is about aircraft development and the dangers of flying in the period before World War II.\n\nPlot\nPhil Mercedes (Richard Dix), once a record-setting pilot, is now an aging alcoholic. As an air show performer, while inebriated, he crashes his stunt aircraft into a barn and is grounded for a year. His sister Kay (Wendy Barrie), his only means of support, hopes to land a job in the drafting department for Martin Ames (Kent Taylor), the chief engineer for Dan McLean (Edmund Lowe), an aircraft manufacturer.\nGiven the war in Europe, the McLean company hopes to win a big contract with the government. Although Kay is not very skilled, she shows Ames some drawings Phil made. The creative designs interest Dan, who approves the construction of a high-speed fighter aircraft. Preliminary tests of the aircraft prove disastrous, with test pilot Dick Allerton (Donald Briggs) contending that the aircraft is too dangerous to fly.\nWith a redesign of the wings, Dick flies the experimental aircraft again, but the landing gear will not extend fully, leaving the test pilot circling the airport. If the aircraft cannot complete its tests, the company will be in danger of bankruptcy. Phil again takes over, successfully wrenching the gear down, but losing his life in the process. With the successful completion of the flight tests, the company is saved.\n\nCast\nProduction\nNovelist Nathanael West was involved in a number of B films in this period, including Men Against the Sky, but recognition of his work was short-lived. Along with his wife Eileen, he was killed in a car crash on December 22, 1940, when West (a notoriously bad driver) ran a stop sign in Southern California. Principal photography for Men Against the Sky took place from late May to June 15, 1940.According to The Hollywood Reporter, Lucille Ball, considered Hollywood's B movie queen, was to play the female lead before Wendy Barrie came on board. Paul Mantz, noted movie stunt pilot, was the aviation consultant. Models were mostly used, but also notable is the use of footage of the experimental Hughes H-1 Racer during its trials.\n\nReception\nMen Against the Sky was generally considered a popular entry in the aviation film genre, although not of the same caliber as Test Pilot (1938) or Men With Wings (1938), which explored the same subject. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times in a contemporary review, characterized Men Against the Sky as a \"generally entertaining little action picture,\" although he criticized its \"maudlin heroics,\" the storyline which was \"routine and obvious\" and the performances that were no better than \"stock and pedestrian.\"\nPassage 6:\nPop Always Pays\nPop Always Pays is a 1940 American comedy film directed by Leslie Goodwins using a screenplay by Charles E.

Hively had to come in and finish the picture after Goodwins was hospitalized for pneumonia. Maureen O'Hara plays an Argentinian who falls in love with a Texan (James Ellison), who is attempting to buy a racehorse from her father. It was one of a number of Hollywood films from the 1940s produced to reflect America's \"Good Neighbor policy\" towards Latin American countries. They Met in Argentina was not well received by audiences, critics, or the Argentine government.\n\nPlot\nTim Kelly (James Ellison) is a Texan in the oil business who travels to Argentina to bid for some land. When his bid is unsuccessful, he teams up with colleague Duke Ferrell (Buddy Ebsen) to buy their employer a successful racehorse, Lucero, in the hope that this will compensate for the failed bid. Tim falls in love with Lolita O'Shea (Maureen O'Hara), the daughter of the racehorse's owner, Don Enrique (Robert Barrat). Don Enrique is against selling Lucero, but when he realises his daughter is in love with Tim, he offers him the racehorse on the condition that he immediately returns to the USA. When Lolita realises Tim has left, she pursues him on horseback.\n\nCast\nMaureen O'Hara as Lolita O'Shea\nJames Ellison as Tim Kelly\nAlberto Vila as Alberto Delmonte\nBuddy Ebsen as Duke Ferrel\nRobert Barrat as Don Enrique de los Santos O'Shea\nJoseph Buloff as Santiago, O'Shea's Trainer\nDiosa Costello as Panchita\n\nBackground and production\nIn the early 1940s, Hollywood studios produced a number of films which reflected America's \"Good Neighbor policy\" towards Latin America; They Met in Argentina was one of RKO Pictures' contributions. With these films set in Latin American countries, the studios hoped to both attract an audience in Latin America and to increase popular interest in the region among a North American audience. Other films of this nature included the Twentieth-Century Fox productions Down Argentine Way (1940) and Blood and Sand (1941).They Met in Argentina was based on a story by Lou Brock, who was also the film's producer. Brock approached Rodgers and Hart to score the production. The pair wrote 12 songs in total, although only 7 of them were included in the final cut. The songs featured in the soundtrack are \"You've Got the Best of Me\", \"North America Meets South America\", \"Amarillo\", \"Lolita\", \"Cutting the Cane\", \"Never Go To Argentina\" and \"Simpatica\". The dance sequences were choreographed by Frank Veloz.When Goodwins was hospitalized for pneumonia during production, RKO brought in veteran director Jack Hively to replace him and finish the film.\n\nReception\nBox office\nThe film fared poorly in cinemas, and made a loss of $270,000.\n\nCritical\nThe film received negative reviews from critics, with Robert Dana in the New York Herald Tribune describing it as \"an American musical at its worst\". Film critic Leonard Maltin later described it as a \"dismal musical\". The Argentine government spoke out against the distribution of the film in Latin America.\nPassage 10:\nDeep South (film)\nDeep South is a 1937 American short film directed by Leslie Goodwins.

Its soundtrack is a mix of subtle sound effects and animals sounds. A non-narrative film, it includes three poetic intertitles written in the first person (e.g., \"If I knew,/ I would assure you we are all / Finally good chickens / And will rise together, / A noisy flock of round, / Dusty angels.\")In 2009, the Librarian of Congress named Scratch and Crow to the National Film Registry, a designation reserved for American films deemed worthy of preservation for being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant. The Library's news release stated: \"Consistent with the short films she made from age 11 until her death at 36, this animated short work is filled with vivid color and a light sense of humor.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 67, based on 15 reviews. Riley Wallace of Exclaim! wrote, \"With exciting production that features his usual cast of ATL tastemakers who are (in some cases) paired with surprising co-producers like Jake One and !llmind, Future has crafted an opus full of bangers. So, while he doesn't break much new creative ground, there's a lot to love about Future.\" Jordan Sargent of Spin dubbed it \"a clear return to form\". Colin Groundwater for Pretty Much Amazing stated that \"Future is too persistent. In striving for consistency, he sacrifices discretion and intention. One wishes he would take a break\u2014God knows he's earned it. Some time might allow for a stronger sense of intention.\"Writing for The Observer, Alex Macpherson concluded, \"...[and] as a body of work, this album is neither an elevation over nor an advancement of his stream of recent material. At this point, merely shoring up his personal brand with scattered highlights means that Future is stuck in a holding pattern.\" Chase McMullen, an author for The 405, said, \"In a genre that's hard on longevity, and an era with an even shorter attention span, Future has refused to lose, time and again. He certainly doesn't end here. Yet, after a year of baited breathing, we seem to have arrived at an in-between. There's still plenty of fun to be had in the waiting room, but let's hope he has more in store for the next appointment.\" Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork, noted the album for being \"...an ambitious Future exhibition\" with \"a pretty interesting array of textures, sonically.\"\n\nCommercial performance\nFuture debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 140,000 album-equivalent units, of which 60,000 were pure album sales.

A streaming version of the album's single, \"Paper Planes\", was released on Spin on July 15, 2008.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 68, based on 12 reviews, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\".Dan Raper of PopMatters praised the album, stating, \"Shiny pieces of melody peek out from the lush pop textures the band\u2019s created all through Who Killed Harry Houdini?. In fact, the album keeps up songwriting quality at a surprisingly consistent level, taking a collective breath before barrelling into a series of fine tunes to close. From \u201cOphelia\u201d\u2019s awkward keyboard switches to the expansive, syncopated refrain of \u201cLittle Ghost\u201d, this section of the disc feels like a nostalgic, triumphant encore. It\u2019s not the last one this band will have demanded of them.\"Marc Hogan of Pitchfork Media was more critical of the album, stating, \"Houdini sounds like an attempt to escape from the predicament of the sophomore album, making more nuanced use of orchestration and sticking with a comfortingly sweet and na\u00efve tone while also expanding its perspective. March-like first single \"Paper Planes\" has sunny guitars, whistling woodwinds, neighbors' sex, and \"The Cosby Show\", slyly invoking the way we pass unseen through the lives of strangers; free mp3 giveaway \"Music Killed Me\" adds a kiddie-psych spaceyness, using the choral vocal to full rhetorical advantage. \"Andy\" politely invites a guy\u2014with the same name as one of my local bartenders!-- to join the band. But nothing here has the euphoric simplicity of \"We're From Barcelona\", or quite the infant-\"Calvin & Hobbes\" wisdom of \"Chicken Pox\" and \"Treehouse\".\"\n\nTrack listing\nPassage 9:\nMetamorphosis (Mercenary album)\nMetamorphosis is the sixth studio album by the Danish melodic death metal band Mercenary.
