NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michael David Elliot, 40, was arrested in Kankakee Township in rural LaPorte County, Ind., and allegedly stole a total of four vehicles in his 24-hour run from the law. He was arraigned Tuesday in Indiana on auto theft charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sheriff\u2019s department had been looking for a black 2002 Chevrolet Monte Carlo that was stolen from the area of Boyd Avenue and E. Lincolnway in LaPorte, authorities said. Deputy Jeffrey Wright said the vehicle\u2019s engine was on so it would warm up when it was taken. The sheriff\u2019s department was alerted to the theft at 6:16 p.m. ET, according to a Monday night news release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Within minutes of learning of the theft, Deputy Slawek Czupryna spotted the stolen vehicle headed south on Boyd Boulevard in LaPorte. He attempted a traffic stop, but the driver didn\u2019t pull over. Instead, the driver fled, leading deputies on a short chase. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stop Sticks were deployed just before 6:30 p.m., the sheriff\u2019s office said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cHe ran over a couple of sets of Stop Sticks that some of our sergeants had laid out, so his tires were going flat. He lost control of the vehicle and slid into a snowbank,\u201d Deputy Wright told 24 Hour News 8. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That snowbank was at the T-intersection of N 250 E between East Division and E 150 N in Kankakee Township, east of LaPorte. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot then tried to climb out of the car\u2019s window, Wright said. Deputies Czupryna and Wright each grabbed one of Elliot\u2019s shoulders, pulled him from the car, laid him on the ground and handcuffed him. No one was hurt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When asked what his name was, Elliot answered truthfully, Wright said. He said he asked Elliot if he was \u201c\u2018the Michael Elliot,\u201d and Elliot confirmed he was the escapee. Wright said he was surprised that Elliot didn\u2019t lie about his identity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wright then put Elliot into the back of his cruiser and took him to the LaPorte County Jail. Elliot is being held without bond on felony car theft and resisting charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wright described Elliot was polite to officers, and quiet and emotionless during the ride to jail. Elliot looked tired, Wright said, like he had not slept in days. Wright said Elliot was wearing jeans that were too big and \u201ca couple of jackets.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wright said authorities didn\u2019t know Elliot would be in their area \u2014 there was more concern he may be in the Shipshewana area \u2014 and that he did not expect the man he was chasing to be Elliot. Wright said he was relieved that he and Czupryna were able to get Elliot off the streets and bring worried citizens some peace of mind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a Monday night news release, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder thanked the law enforcement agencies that aided in the search and capture of Elliot. \u201cThe swift apprehension of this dangerous criminal is a credit to law enforcement and corrections officials in Michigan and Indiana, and our partners with the U.S. Marshals Service. Their courage, diligence and professionalism reminds us how fortunate we are to have such men and women who are willing to keep our communities safe. \u2026Now that we are assured the public is safe, we will turn our attention to thoroughly reviewing the situation that led to the prisoner\u2019s escape.

Elliot then got through a hole in the fencing system which, according to a former corrections officer, is made up of two 12-foot high, razor wire-topped fencing sections with a smaller, electrified fence in between them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He then made a three-and-a-half mile trek into Ionia where he carjacked a woman, police said. The two then drove to the Elkhart, Ind. area.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LaPorte County, where Elliot was arrested, is west of Shipshewana. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot was serving five life sentences in the Ionia Correctional Facility after being convicted of four 1993 murders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the early morning of Aug. 8, 1993, according to court documents, Elliot broke into a home in Bentley Township, north of Midland, killed four people then set the house on fire. Vickie Currie, her boyfriend Michael Tufnell, his cousin Bruce Squires Tufnell Jr. and fiancee Cathy Lave were killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Charles and Paul Treece, and Tammy LaCross were with Elliot when the murders were committed.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The manhunt for 40-year- old Elliot started Sunday night, after he escaped from Ionia Correctional Facility in Michigan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot was convicted of four murders in 1993 and is serving five life sentences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michigan Department of Corrections Director Dan Heyns says officers realized Elliot was gone during a routine count at about 9 p.m. Sunday. After looking at surveillance tapes, they realized he escaped somewhere between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Heyns says during the time of the escape, Elliot was dressed in a white kitchen uniform. It is unknown at this time how he got that uniform. Heyns says Elliot was not assigned to the kitchen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They believe it was the color of that uniform that had something to do with his ability to get by multiple security cameras and interior and perimeter fencing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After escaping, Elliot carjacked a woman using a box cutter. He held her hostage during the more than 100-mile drive to Elkhart County. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They stopped for gas around 11 p.m. at a Marathon gas station near the intersection of SR 13 and CR 2, near Middlebury. The woman escaped Elliot at the station by asking for a cup for water, then locking herself in the bathroom and calling 911. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot fled in the victim's car before police arrived. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indiana State Police say the red Jeep Liberty he fled in was found in the 400 block of North State Street in Shipshewana Monday afternoon. A woman living in the neighborhood noticed the car matched the description of one given on the news, so she called police around 12:15 p.m. But, police say the car was seen in the area as early as 5:30 a.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You can go a lot of places in seven hours,\" said Sgt.

Westview Schools were notified of the situation and placed on lock down. Students were later dismissed, with a heavy police presence on site to ensure their safety. Police say all students were accounted for and the schools were thoroughly searched. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indiana State Police say after searching the community, their hunt for Elliot in Shipshewana has been suspended and they have no new leads. They don't know if he is still in Michiana or has traveled elsewhere since abandoning the Jeep. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What we're asking the public to do is to remain vigilant,\" Galaviz said. \"If you see something, say something. If something appears out of order, if a door seems unlocked, if a window is broken, don't investigate it.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The crime, which brought strong condemnations from the Obama Administration and European officials, threatened to throw the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians beyond the control of leaders who were calculating how to respond to the last outrage without further escalating tensions on the ground. But in the space of a few hours, the mood shifted from communal grief over the deaths of the young Israelis to fears of ascending communal violence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The abduction followed a night of mayhem by Jewish extremists, about 200 of whom marched through Jerusalem chanting \u201cDeath to the Arabs\u201d and assaulting Arab Israelis found on the streets. A few hours later, shortly before 4 a.m., Muhammad Hussein Abu Khdeir, 16, was forced into a car by two men on a sidewalk not far from his home in Shuafat, a Palestinian neighborhood of East Jerusalem. An hour later police discovered a charred body in a forest on the outskirts of the city. Family members said it was Muhammad, who had been on his way to dawn prayers, as was customary during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe settlers killed my son, they kidnapped him and killed him,\u201d his father, Hussein Saed Abu Khdeir, told TIME after returning from Jerusalem\u2019s main police station. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He reached for his Samsung smartphone, tapped the screen and pulled up a photo of two young men on a sidewalk. He said the image had been taken from a surveillance camera at a candy store around the corner that recorded the abduction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThese are the ones who kidnapped my son,\u201d he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A few yards away, dozens of young men flung stones at Israeli riot police assembled two blocks downhill. The riot began shortly after the body was discovered, and went on all day. Police fired foam-tipped bullets and sound grenades. Youths twirled slingshots and the occasional Molotov cocktail. The pavement between the two sides might have been gravel, so littered was it with stones. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A row of ambulances stood by a hundred feet behind the tin barricades protesters had erected beside the building containing the Khdeirs\u2019 home. As an ambulance driver reported that more than 60 people had been wounded by 5 p.m., another injured youth arrived, slung across the shoulders of a heavyset man in an orange medic\u2019s vest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement urging both sides \u201cnot to take the law into your own hands\u201d and promising to \u201cuncover quickly who is behind this despicable murder and what motivated it.\u201d A relative of one of the Jewish Israeli teens, Naftali Fraenkel, who also held U.S. citizenship, was quoted as saying \u201cIf a young Arab man was murdered for nationalistic reasons then it is a horrifying and disgusting act. There is no distinguishing blood from blood. Murder is murder, whatever the nationality or age may be. There is no justification, no forgiveness and no atonement for any murder.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the distance between the sides grows with each incident. At the political level, Palestinian leaders leaped at the opportunity to turn the tables on Israel, which used the teens\u2019 disappearance as a pretense to arrest more than 400 West Bank activists, most of them with the militant Islamist group Hamas that Netanyahu blames for the teens\u2019 deaths. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIsrael bears full responsibility for this incident,\u201d Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said in a statement, which concluded with a threat to drag Israel before U.N. courts, the most militant course Abbas has been willing to chart. \u201cThe Palestinian leadership will continue its discussions following this escalation, including joining international organizations.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the ground, pessimism ruled. Hussein Abu Khdeir was asked if he had faith in the Israeli police he had spent most of the day with. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. Why not? \u201cBecause we\u2019re Arab.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThey are not concerned,\u201d volunteered Yousef Mkhemer, a community activist seated across the crowded porch.

So he cannot shame himself.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The distrust runs beyond political leader, however, to alternate realities. Many if not most Palestinians refuse to say that the three Israeli teens were abducted at all. Their disappearance is widely regarded as an excuse to force apart the newly minted unity government supported by both Hamas and Abbas\u2019 secular Fatah party \u2014 a reconciliation polls show has been enthusiastically embraced by Palestinians, but condemned by Netanyahu, who has repeatedly invoked the teens\u2019 kidnapping as reason for dismembering it.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Results in Brief NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The California Whistleblower Protection Act (Whistleblower Act) empowers the California State Auditor's Office (State Auditor) to investigate and report on improper governmental activities by agencies and employees of the State. Under the Whistleblower Act, an improper governmental activity includes any action by a state agency or employee related to state government that violates a law; is economically wasteful; or involves gross misconduct, incompetence, or inefficiency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018, the State Auditor conducted investigative work on 1,481 cases. This report contains seven examples of investigations that substantiated improper governmental activities, including misuse of state time and inaccurate attendance records, economically wasteful activities, and misuse of government property. In addition, during the past year, the State Auditor issued nonpublic reports regarding nepotism, bad-faith hires, improper promotions, and other misconduct by executive management within two state entities. It provided these reports to those who could remediate the problems and ensure that the management teams involved did not retaliate against perceived whistleblowers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California State University, Fresno NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two facilities operations employees at California State University, Fresno engaged in egregious and continued time and attendance abuse by taking extended breaks or leaving campus without accounting for their time. From 2013 through 2017, two employees failed to account for more than 5,100 hours of work, costing the State more than $111,000 in salary paid for work not performed. Furthermore, the employees were dishonest in their attempts to conceal their time and attendance abuse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Kern Valley State Prison NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For about two years, an employee at Kern Valley State Prison misused state time by regularly leaving work up to 45 minutes early as a result of inadequate supervision.

During this period, the LVN continued to receive her pay as a nurse even though she provided patient care only when she worked occasional overtime shifts, causing California Correctional Health Care Services (Correctional Health Care) to waste $10,500 in unnecessary salary payments. Furthermore, the nursing director's decision cost the State an additional $18,700 in unnecessary overtime payments that Correctional Health Care paid to other nurses to cover the LVN's originally assigned post, resulting in total waste of nearly $30,000.

In addition, the associate warden violated state law by choosing not to initiate any collection efforts after two internal audits in 2017 documented the error in pay and recommended the recovery of the overpayments.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stones and petrol bombs flew between opposition protesters and supporters of President Mohamed Mursi who had flocked to the palace in response to a call from the Muslim Brotherhood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two Islamists were hit in the legs by what their friends said were bullets fired during the clashes in streets around the compound in northern Cairo. One of them was bleeding heavily. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A leftist group said Islamists had cut off the ear of one of its members. Medical sources said 23 people had been wounded in clashes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Riot police deployed between the two sides to try to stop the confrontations which flared after dark despite an attempt by Vice President Mahmoud Mekky to calm the political crisis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said amendments to disputed articles in the draft constitution could be agreed with the opposition. A written agreement could then be submitted to the next parliament, to be elected after a referendum on the constitution on Dec. 15. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There must be consensus,\" he told a news conference, saying opposition demands had to be respected to reach a solution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facing the gravest crisis of his six-month-old tenure, Mursi has shown no sign of buckling, confident that Islamists can win the referendum and a parliamentary election to follow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many Egyptians yearn for an end to political upheaval that has scared off investors and tourists, damaging the economy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egypt's opposition coalition blamed Mursi for the violence around his palace and said it was ready for dialogue if the Islamist leader scrapped a decree he issued on Nov. 22 that gave him wide powers and shielded his decisions from judicial review. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We hold President Mursi and his government completely responsible for the violence happening in Egypt today,\" opposition coordinator Mohamed ElBaradei told a news conference.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mursi has said his decree was needed to prevent courts still full of judges appointed by ousted strongman Hosni Mubarak from derailing a constitution vital for Egypt's political transition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rival groups skirmished outside the presidential palace earlier on Wednesday. Islamist supporters of Mursi tore down tents erected by leftist foes, who had begun a sit-in there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They hit us and destroyed our tents. Are you happy, Mursi? Aren't we Egyptians too?\" asked protester Haitham Ahmed.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It needs to be a two-way dialogue ... among Egyptians themselves about the constitutional process and the substance of the constitution,\" Clinton told a news conference in Brussels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Washington is worried about rising Islamist power in Egypt, a staunch U.S. security partner under Mubarak, who preserved the U.S.-brokered peace treaty Cairo signed with Israel in 1979. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Muslim Brotherhood had summoned supporters to an open-ended demonstration at the presidential palace, a day after about 10,000 opposition protesters had encircled it for what organisers dubbed a \"last warning\" to Mursi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The people want the downfall of the regime,\" they chanted, roaring the signature slogan of last year's anti-Mubarak revolt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The \"last warning\" may turn out to be one of the last gasps for a disparate opposition that has little chance of scuttling next week's vote on the draft constitution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State institutions, with the partial exception of the judiciary, have mostly fallen in behind Mursi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The army, the muscle behind all previous Egyptian presidents in the republic's six-decade history, has gone back to barracks, having apparently lost its appetite to intervene in politics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a bold move, Mursi sacked Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the Mubarak-era army commander and defence minister, in August and removed the sweeping powers that the military council, which took over after Mubarak fell, had grabbed two months earlier.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"No to dictatorship,\" Mursi's opponents chanted, while their rivals chanted: \"Defending Mursi is defending Islam.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mursi's opponents accused him of creating a new autocracy by awarding himself extraordinary powers in a decree on November 22 and were further angered when an Islamist-dominated assembly pushed through a draft constitution that opponents said did not properly represent the aspirations of the whole nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States, worried about the stability of a state that has a peace deal with Israel and to which it gives $1.3 billion in military aid each year, called for dialogue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bidding to end the worst crisis since Mursi took office less than six months ago, Vice President Mahmoud Mekky said amendments to disputed articles in the constitution could be agreed with the opposition. A written agreement could then go to parliament, to be elected after a referendum on the constitution on December 15.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On top of the support of the Brotherhood, which backed him for the presidency in the June election, Mursi may also be able to rely on a popular yearning for stability and economic revival after almost two years of political turmoil. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egypt's opposition coalition blamed Mursi for the violence and said it was ready for dialogue if the Islamist leader scrapped the decree that gave him wide powers and shielded his decisions from judicial review. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Today what is happening in the Egyptian street, polarization and division, is something that could and is actually drawing us to violence and could draw us to something worse,\" opposition coordinator Mohamed ElBaradei said on Wednesday.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'REAL DANGER' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Opposition leaders have previously urged Mursi to retract the decree, defer the referendum and agree to revise the constitution, but have not echoed calls from street protesters for his overthrow and the \"downfall of the regime\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mursi has said his decree was needed to prevent courts still full of judges appointed by Mubarak from derailing a constitution vital for Egypt's political transition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mekky said street mobilization by both sides posed a \"real danger\" to Egypt. \"If we do not put a stop to this phenomenon right away ... where are we headed? We must calm down.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton weighed into Egypt's political debate, saying dialogue was urgently needed on the new constitution, which should \"respect the rights of all citizens\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clinton and Mursi worked together last month to broker a truce between Israel and Hamas Islamists in the Gaza Strip. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR British Foreign Secretary William Hague called for restraint on all sides. He said Egypt's authorities had to make progress on the transition in an \"inclusive manner\" and urged dialogue.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both men served as guards at the Stutthof concentration camp, located near what is now the Polish city of Gdansk, Dortmund prosecutor Andreas Brendel told The Associated Press. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The indictments were filed against a 93-year-old man from Borken who served in Stutthof from June 1942 to September 1944 and a 92-year-old man from Wuppertal who was there from June 1944 to May 1945. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The charges were filed last week at the state court in Muenster but only announced Wednesday because the defendants first had to be notified. Both deny they had any knowledge of killings at the camp, Brendel said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 65,000 people died at Stutthof. Some were put to death in gas chambers or shot, while others died from malnutrition or froze to death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The men, who have not been named, both served as guards and also watched over prisoners who were taken outside the camp to work. During the time they were at Stutthof, hundreds of killings occurred. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Members of the SS killed more than 100 Polish prisoners and some 77 Soviet prisoners of war in the camp's gas chamber in 1944. An unknown number of Jews also were gassed there in late 1944. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Between June 1944 and April 1945, SS members also killed several hundred Jews by shooting them in the back of the neck. SS-physicians and nurses at Stutthof killed more than 140 prisoners, many of them Jewish women and children, by injecting their hearts with gasoline and the chemical compound phenol from late 1942 until late 1944. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The prosecutors assume that the accused were aware of the different killing methods ...and that such a multitude of people could have only been killed with such regularity because the victims were guarded by helpers like them,\" the court wrote in a statement issued Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two men therefore willingly supported several hundreds of killings of camp inmates in their function as guards, the statement added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR German prosecutors in recent years have pursued Nazi suspects under new legal reasoning that, even without evidence of a specific crime, they can be prosecuted if they helped camps operate.\nPassage 2:\nIn Judith Meisel\u2019s last image of her mother, Mina, she is standing outside a gas chamber at the Stutthof concentration camp in Poland, awaiting the same fate that befell 65,000 other prisoners there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This summer, as she has countless times before, the St. Louis Park resident relived the experience in wrenching detail, but this time for a set of German prosecutors who, aided by Minnesota FBI agents, were racing to bring to justice the few Nazis still alive who can be linked to World War II-era atrocities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now Meisel, 88, knows her assistance paid off: German authorities this month indicted two ex-guards on charges of being accessories to many of the murders at Stutthof, located near what is now the Polish city of Gdansk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under German law, Meisel could join prosecutors as a \u201cco-plaintiff\u201d in the case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In June, Meisel stunned the Germans, and her family, when she identified one of the ex-guards, Johann Rehbogen, as a teenage SS officer who taunted her and other female prisoners as they undressed each morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The charges, made possible by new German legal guidance allowing the prosecution of former Nazis who can\u2019t be tied to specific killings, represent a new and vital chapter for survivors like Meisel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Holocaust survivor Judy Meisel held a photo of her parents Osser Beker and Mika Beker that was taken around 1938. Judy's mother died in the gas chamber at Stutthof concentration camp on the Baltic coast in late 1944 or early 1945. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI understand that the person who has been indicted was a young man at the time,\u201d Meisel said. \u201cStill, the questions he must answer are an important part of this story.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How, for example, did he take such a gruesome job at such a young age? What did he think when he watched women and children being killed on an industrial scale? How has he explained his past to his family and friends? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel awaits any details the 94-year-old Rehbogen can provide, even if it means she must again relive the horror of her years inside the camp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThis process of seeking answers and finding justice for my mother gives new meaning to my life,\u201d Meisel said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What comes next? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prosecutors in Dortmund indicted Rehbogen and Harry Paul Fritz Schulz, 92, on charges stemming from their tenures at the camp from 1942 to 1944. Since 2011, German authorities have been pursuing cases against Nazis whom they believe they can prove helped operate concentration camps during the war. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Dortmund prosecutor told the Associated Press this month that both men denied knowing anything about the killings at the camp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel\u2019s description of life in the camp \u2014 and law enforcement interviews with other Americans identified as Stutthof survivors \u2014 are essential for prosecutors to challenge those denials. In June, Meisel instantly recognized a photo of Rehbogen, whom she and other prisoners called \u201cMeydele\u201d for his girlish looks, and said he was among those who taunted and beat prisoners. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cornelius Nestler, a German professor and lawyer who has represented Holocaust survivors in similar cases, found Meisel online and connected her with German authorities who weren\u2019t sure how many, if any, Stutthof survivors were still alive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nestler told the Star Tribune in an e-mail that the defendants will have an opportunity to challenge the indictment and will likely be evaluated by medical experts for their fitness to stand trial. Nestler said that the trial could commence next summer if the defendants are deemed healthy enough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel, he said, could \u201ctake the stand as a witness,\u201d or at least observe the proceedings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2018Important lessons\u2019 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel\u2019s son, Michael Cohen, said he\u2019s not sure if his mother would travel to Germany or participate in the prosecution from afar. German authorities also named witnesses from Ohio, New Jersey, New York and Florida. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The charges came as a surprise to the family, Cohen said, and represented a determination not to \u201csimply move aside and forget about\u201d those responsible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen, a Minneapolis attorney, said news of the charges brought back new, vivid memories for his mother that include witnessing camp inmates killed by injections administered by Stutthof doctors. Meisel has since spent much of the month thinking of her mother and sister Rachel, who was forced on a death march away from the camp with her in early 1945 that they both escaped. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen said Meisel has described her mother as a woman of forgiveness, but is still unsure how she would respond to the charges. \u201cShe\u2019s very interested in what comes next,\u201d Cohen said this week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also said the wave of emotions has taken its toll on his mother. As an activist, she has told her story to audiences across the country, but in the days since learning of the indictments, Meisel has privately revisited what it meant to be a Stutthof inmate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While she still has nightmares, Meisel said she welcomes any chance to tell her story \u201cfor the important lessons it teaches about tolerance and racism.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said she cannot forget the message from some of her fellow prisoners: \u201cDon\u2019t let us die without you mentioning what happened to us.\u201d\n", "answers": ["Judith Meisel says that when she was a teenager in the Stutthof concentration camp in western Poland, other prisoners told her: \"Don't let us die without you mentioning what happened to us.\" The 88-year-old Minnesota resident has not forgotten: Her testimony helped German authorities indict two former guards from the camp where 65,000 people, including Meisel's mother, died, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports. She identified one former guard, 94-year-old Johann Rehbogen, as the young SS officer who would taunt female prisoners as they undressed. Prosecutors say the men can't be tied to specific murders, but their work as guards made the killings possible.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite the abundance of good intentions, though, the city and surrounding areas are feeling the strain of so many refugees. The afterglow of January\u2019s jubilant revolution has largely given way to old frustrations, with people complaining of a stagnant economy, inadequate infrastructure and widespread unemployment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The police, the lackeys of the deposed government, are largely absent from the streets, having gone into hiding after the revolution.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The struggle between forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and rebels trying to end his more than four decades of rule drew in outsiders last month, as NATO began air strikes on government troops under a United Nations mandate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But on Thursday the fighting spilled over Libya's land frontier, when Gaddafi troops battled rebels on Tunisian territory for control of the Dehiba-Wazin frontier crossing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The incursion was brief and limited, and Gaddafi's troops even apologized locally. But the response was nevertheless furious from Tunisia, where the Arab world's wave of uprisings began late last year, leading to the overthrow of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in January. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Given the gravity of what has happened ... the Tunisian authorities have informed the Libyans of their extreme indignation and demand measures to put an immediate stop to these violations,\" a Tunisian Foreign Ministry statement said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Illustrating the difficulty of keeping the Libyan conflict sealed within the country's land borders, artillery shells fired by Gaddafi forces also struck the Tunisian side of the crossing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rebels seized the post a week ago, as it controls the only road link which their comrades in Libya's Western Mountains have with the outside world, making them rely otherwise on rough tracks for supplies of food, fuel and medicine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After weeks of advances and retreats by rebel and government forces along the Mediterranean coast, fighting has settled into a pattern of clashes and skirmishes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thursday's battle for the crossing between Dehiba in Tunisia and Wazin on the Libyan side was typical of the fluid and confused conflict, which broke out in mid-February. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR First government troops stormed the post in what appeared to be part of a broader offensive to root out rebel outposts beyond their eastern heartland around Benghazi, Libya's second city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gaddafi's soldiers apologized to their Tunisian counterparts for the incursion and hoisted their flag at the border, tearing down a pre-Gaddafi era flag that had fluttered for a few days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But then the rebels, who had retreated into Tunisia, counter-attacked and as the fog of war descended, rumors spread that the post was back in their hands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the confusion, scores of vehicles headed for the border from the Tunisian side with civilians on board shouting \"We've won! We've won!\" but they swiftly turned back when they found Gaddafi's forces were still there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MISRATA'S PLIGHT DEEPENS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the port city of Misrata, the rebels' biggest enclave in western Libya, the plight of residents worsened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rebels accused Gaddafi's forces of firing bigger rockets than the Russian-made Grad missiles largely used until now. A rebel called Marwan said in an audio statement on YouTube that the bigger rockets cause much greater destruction. \"Gaddafi the tyrant is trying to wipe out the city of Misrata,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gaddafi denies his forces are attacking civilians and says his opponents are Islamist militants and foreign-backed agitators who deliberately put non-combatants in harm's way. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rebel spokesman Abdelsalam said from Misrata that there had been sporadic clashes on the road to the port and shelling of residential areas. \"Those areas are packed with civilians who fled the fighting in the city center,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The ball is now in NATO's court. After Gaddafi's soldiers and snipers were driven out from the city center and Tripoli Street by the rebel fighters, their strategy has been to shell the city from the outskirts. This can only be solved by NATO.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Western alliance has been conducting air strikes on Libya since last month under a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for civilians to be protected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But military deadlock in Libya has exposed growing international rifts, with critics of NATO bombing calling it another case of the West trying to overthrow a government by stretching the terms of a U.N. resolution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least two loud explosions were heard in Tripoli on Thursday night and NATO jets rumbled overhead. It was not immediately clear what the targets were. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The official Libyan news agency Jana also said that \"the colonial, crusader aggression\" hit civilian and military sites in a Western Mountains region town on Thursday evening. Two people were killed and many others were wounded, it said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gaddafi forces also took a town in the remote southeastern desert, state television reported. \"Libyan forces have seized full control of the town of Kufra and purified it of the armed gangs,\" it quoted a military spokesman as saying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But rebels denied this. \"The battle is not over and the situation is unclear,\" said spokesman Mohamed al-Muntasser.

The son of first-generation German Jewish immigrants, Julius Rosenwald, known to his friends as \"JR,\" apprenticed for his uncles, who were major clothing manufacturers in New York City. It would be as a men\u2019s clothing salesperson that JR would make his fateful encounter with Sears, Roebuck and Company, which he eventually fashioned into the greatest mail order firm in the world.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ascoli\u2019s account of Rosenwald is an inspiring story of hard work and success, and of giving back to the nation in which he prospered.\nPassage 2:\nPHILADELPHIA (JTA) \u2014 Alex Bethea, the son of cotton and tobacco farm workers, was in sixth grade in 1965 when his family moved from Dillon, South Carolina, to the tiny town of Fairmont, North Carolina, where he attended a school called Rosenwald. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it wasn\u2019t until this week, 50 years later, that Bethea learned that his school was named for Julius Rosenwald, the Jewish philanthropist who is the subject of a new documentary by Aviva Kempner. The film tells the little-known story of Rosenwald\u2019s contribution to African-American culture and education. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The revelation came at a July 14 session at the national convention of the NAACP, which drew several thousand delegates to Philadelphia.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosenwald, who made his fortune at the helm of Sears, Roebuck and Co., also provided seed money to build YMCAs for blacks in cities around the country. In addition, he developed a huge apartment complex in Chicago to help improve the living conditions for the masses who had migrated from the Jim Crow South. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful story of cooperation between this philanthropist who did not have to care about black people, but who did, and who expended his considerable wealth in ensuring that they got their fair shake in America,\u201d Julian Bond, the renowned civil rights leader, says in the documentary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kempner told JTA that her new film on Rosenwald \u201ccelebrates the affinity between African-Americans and Jews\u201d that started long before the civil rights movement and speaks to the powerful Jewish tradition of tikkun olam, or repairing the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kempner joined Bond and Rabbi David Saperstein, the former head of the Reform movement\u2019s Religious Action Center who now serves as U.S. ambassador at large for International Religious Freedom, for a discussion after the screening at the NAACP conference. It was while attending a public program 12 years ago on Martha\u2019s Vineyard at which Bond and Saperstein discussed black-Jewish relations that Kempner first learned of Rosenwald\u2019s work with African-Americans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She calls this film the last of a trilogy documenting the lives of \u201cunder-known Jewish heroes.\u201d The first two were about baseball legend Hank Greenberg and radio and TV personality Gertrude Berg. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Interspersing archival footage with interviews with prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou and U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), both of whom attended Rosenwald schools, the documentary tracks the ascent of Rosenwald, the son of German immigrants who rose to become one of the most powerful businessmen and philanthropists in early 20th-century America. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His father, Sam, who came to America in 1851, began, like so many Jewish immigrants of his time, as a peddler. He eventually settled in Springfield, Illinois, where Julius grew up across the street from Abraham Lincoln\u2019s home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1878, his parents sent the 16-year-old Julius to New York to apprentice with his uncles in the men\u2019s clothing manufacturing business. He returned to Illinois to start his own manufacturing company, and through some business and family connections ultimately partnered with Richard Sears, one of the founders of Sears, Roebuck and Co. After Rosenwald took over the company in 1908, it became the largest retailer in the country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Outside his business life, Rosenwald was heavily influenced by his rabbi, Emil Hirsch, the spiritual leader of the Chicago Sinai Congregation, and he became a major benefactor of Jewish causes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The film\u2019s historians document the parallels Rosenwald drew at the time between the pogroms against European Jews and violent attacks on blacks in America NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The film\u2019s historians document the parallels Rosenwald drew at the time between the pogroms against European Jews and violent attacks on blacks in America. He was particularly moved by the race riots in 1908 in Springfield, which are said to have sparked the founding of the NAACP. Hirsch was one of the original leaders of the NAACP, and Rosenwald sponsored its first meetings at his temple. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was also influenced by the writings of Booker T. Washington, a prominent black leader at the time, and became a funder of Washington\u2019s Tuskegee University in Alabama. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Rosenwald gave a $25,000 gift to Tuskegee, Washington suggested taking a few thousand dollars to build six schools for young children. Until then, most black children didn\u2019t attend school, but instead spent their time working in the fields alongside their parents. The few schools that did exist were primitive shacks staffed mostly by untrained teachers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rather than donating all the money for the schools, Rosenwald gave one-third of the funds needed and challenged the local black community to raise another third and the local white community to contribute the rest. In the end, some 5,300 schools were built with seed money from the Rosenwald Fund. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Rosenwald Fund \u2018was the single-most important funding agency for African- American culture in the 20th century\u2019 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fund soon switched focus and began supporting promising black artists, helping catapult dozens onto the national stage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Rosenwald Fund \u201cwas the single-most important funding agency for African- American culture in the 20th century,\u201d poet Rita Dove says in the film. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kempner calls Rosenwald one of the greatest examplars of American Jewish philanthropy and says she hopes her film \u2013 whose official opening in theaters is scheduled for mid-August \u2014 will motivate others to continue that tradition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cNot all of us can be Julius Rosenwald,\u201d she said, noting that he gave away a total of $62 million in his lifetime, but \u201cwe can all do something.\u201d\nPassage 3:\nScreenshot from the Rosenwald documentary Julius Rosenwald stands with black American students who attended one of over 5,000 schools he built for African-American students in the 20th century. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the trailer for the documentary Rosenwald, civil rights activist and U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) describes the type of school he went to as a child. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It was a little school a short distance from my home\u2014walking distance. Beautiful little building. It was a Rosenwald school. It was the only school we had,\" Lewis said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Rosenwald school\u2014named after Julius Rosenwald, a 20th-century Jewish philanthropist who made his fortune by co-founding the department store we refer to today as Sears. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The trailer, released exclusively by The Root, describes how Rosenwald was a relentless businessman but was also deeply inspired by the works and racial-equality teachings of Booker T. Washington. Or, more specifically, Washington's emphasis on what a solid education could do for the racially disadvantaged in America. So much so that Rosenwald teamed up with Washington, and together they hatched a plan to build over 5,000 schools for black students in the Jim Crow South. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was a pretty important endeavor, since segregation prohibited blacks from attending the all-white schools in many Southern states. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The late poet Maya Angelou appears in the documentary, which is slated to be released in New York Aug. 14, and the rest of the nation throughout the fall. Angelou spoke about one of the schools she attended as a child, a school that was also built by Rosenwald. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I thought my school was grand. It was the Lafayette County Training School,\" Angelou said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Civil rights and education-reform activist Julian Bonds is also a product of a Rosenwald school. He explained the significance of a Jewish man in the middle of the 20th century committing himself so vehemently to the idea that black American children must be educated.

It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson. It \"was the single-most important funding agency for African-American culture in the 20th century,\" poet Rita Dove says.

Neighbors identified Adebowale after police armed with submachine guns raided his flat yesterday, emerging with two children, a baby, and two large envelopes. Adebowale was apparently known for distributing radical Islamist leaflets, and his girlfriend had recently converted to Islam. \"When you walked past, you would hear them singing Muslim songs,\" one neighbor says, adding that she \"saw the man who was in the video go inside the house.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Today marks the 20th anniversary of Take Our Daughters to Work Day. The event, which now includes our sons too, is still a valuable chance to help children understand the workplace.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What we need now is Take Our Daughters to the C-Suite Day \u2013 the offices occupied by corporate \"chiefs.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Twenty years ago, the Ms. Foundation launched the program to demystify the workplace for girls and inspire them to embrace a wide range of careers. Now that women represent half the US workforce, we can fairly say that mission has been accomplished. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Girls no longer need help picturing themselves in a job; what they do need is encouragement to become leaders. In Fortune 500 companies, women make up just 3.6 percent of CEOs, 14 percent of executive officers, and 16 percent of board directors. Companies need to do much more to inspire women to lead, rather than blaming the lack of women leaders on what Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg calls an \u201cambition gap.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Companies that are already committing time and resources to Take Our Children to Work Day can help close that gap by shifting their focus in three ways: introducing girls to female role models; more clearly explaining what leaders of both genders actually do; and supporting programs throughout the year that actively identify and groom female talent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Introducing girls to a company\u2019s highest ranking women is an easy step any organization can add to their career day programs \u2013 and it\u2019s one that can make a huge difference.

Boys, in contrast, see a variety of male leaders in all aspects of their lives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Companies can help girls by using the day to introduce their employees\u2019 daughters to women at the highest level of the company. And highlighting these leaders\u2019 accomplishments will give the women themselves more visibility.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The claim against Rasheen Rose's estate cited his total Medicaid assistance from Aug. 6, 2002, through Aug. 6, 2012, the day he died.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The battery-powered toy is designed to slowly peck its way through the surrounding shell after the egg is rubbed, tapped and warmed, according to the lawsuit. But Jodie Hejduk of Bakersfield filed the complaint, on behalf of a class of other affected people, against Hatchimals' parent company Spin Master after she says the toy she purchased did not hatch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hejduk says in the lawsuit that she purchased the Hatchimal for approximately $50 on January 14 as a birthday gift for her daughter. She claims she and her daughter followed directions included in the package and the Hatchimal failed to hatch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hejduk is suing for damages relating to Spin Master's \"deceptive business practices in selling Hatchimals,\" according to the lawsuit. Her attorney Mark Geragos, alleges that the company misrepresented the toy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The product is defective and it's unfortunate for all those people because there was kind of a craze about it,\" Geragos told ABC News. \"They ought to rename it the 'bait and switch.'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Geragos said Hedjuk was denied a refund or a product repair. The lawsuit also cites several negative reviews on Amazon.com from other consumers saying the toy was defective. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"My guess is there will be more lawsuits filed any day,\" Geragos said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master released Hatchimals, which retailed for $50 to $60, on October 7, 2016. But the popular toy often sold out, creating a market for resellers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"By November 2016, the products were difficult to find and sold out in many locations, which led to a black market for Hatchimals,\" the lawsuit alleges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Soon, Hatchimals were selling on e-commerce sites for hundreds of dollars, but many parents and children were allegedly let down after the item failed to live up to its name. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Spin Master knew that the 'hatching' was one of the primary draws of the toy,\" the lawsuit said. \"Since children do not know what is inside of the egg,\" the lawsuit alleges that according to a Spin Master senior vice president,\"they get excited about what they may get.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lawsuit goes onto to say, \"This excitement was replaced with extreme disappointment for the many children when their Hatchimals did not hatch.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lawsuit also alleges that Spin Master has failed to take \"proper action to address its malfunctioning product.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After receiving complaints that the toy didn't hatch, the company posted onto Facebook that they are \"100% committed to bringing the magic of Hatchimals\" to all of its customers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a statement to ABC News in December, the company said that while \"the vast majority of children have had a magical experience with Hatchimals,\" it also acknowledged it had received calls from consumers who had \"encountered challenges\" and that, \"To ensure all queries receive a timely response, we have increased the number of Consumer Care representatives, extended our hours, and increased the capacity for callers in the queue to help prevent calls dropped due to the holiday volume.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have also created troubleshooting tips on Hatchimals.com and a video with 'The Top 5 Things to Know About Hatchimals',\" the December statement continued. \"We are committed to doing everything possible to resolve any consumer issues.

Now, that disappointment has led to legal action. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jodie Hejduk of Bakersfield, California, has filed a class-action lawsuit against Spin Master, alleging the Hatchimal toy she purchased for her daughter never hatched. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hatchimals are stuffed animals that start out inside a spotted plastic egg, and are supposed to hatch when the owner rubs the shell. That process should take 25 to 40 minutes, according to Spin Master's website. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But that wasn't the case for \"millions of families throughout this country,\" Hejduk said in her lawsuit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Millions of children and families across the globe were sourly disappointed with coal in their stockings, in the form of a bait-and-switch marketing scheme perpetrated by Spin Master, the manufacturers of this Christmas season's 'it' gift, Hatchimals,\" the lawsuit says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Spin Master knew that the 'hatching' was one of the primary draws of the toy,\" the suit continued. \"One of the company's senior vice presidents recognized that getting the toy to hatch 'resonates well with kids' and that since children do not know what is inside of the egg 'they get excited about what they may get.' This excitement was replaced with extreme disappointment for the many children when their Hatchimals did not hatch.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Hatchimal cost about $50, depending on the retailer. However, the part-Furby, part-Tamagotchi toys were popular on the resale market, where they sold for upward of $250. Many parents lined up outside Toys R Us and Wal-Mart stores to purchase the highly sought-after toy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, once children opened their Christmas presents, the buzz surrounding the toys quickly turned from, \"Where do I find one?\" to \"This thing doesn't hatch.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I paid triple the price so I could get my 5 yr. old daughter what she wanted but when it was time to play with it the Hatchimal would not respond inside the egg.

The creature inside is a mystery, making kids excited to see what they may get. The hatching is the toy\u2019s signature attraction, according to the Jan. 19 lawsuit against Spin Master Corp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master released the toys in early October 2016, in time for the holidays, and they quickly became the year\u2019s must-have gift. By November they were hard to find. Some parents waited for hours outside toy stores; others paid up to seven times the retail price eBay and other internet sites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hatchimals typically sold for $50 to $60. They were advertised Monday morning for $79.99 on the Toys Are U website, and for $59.99 on the Wal-Mart website, which, however, was out of stock. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master made an estimated $100 million in profits off the toy, attorney Ben Meiselas said in an interview, but investigations indicate that its failure rate is exceptionally high. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThis was an aggressive and brilliant marketing campaign built on a house of cards and lies for a product that was not ready for the market,\u201d Meiselas said. \u201cSpin Master knew it was spinning consumers; they knew the product didn\u2019t hatch.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He noted the irony of the company\u2019s name: Spin Master. Stories told by families who bought the toy \u201cborder on extreme disappointment to tragic, depending on different families\u2019 situations and their ability to purchase these expensive items,\u201d said Meiselas, of Geragos & Geragos in Los Angeles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThey were playing on the most visceral emotions of a family: a child\u2019s happiness. It exceeds a mere letdown and caused real damages.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many consumers who tried to solve the problem by contacting Spin Master hit a brick wall, as customer service never returned their calls or messages, \u201cwith some customers reporting being on hold for as long as three hours before having their call disconnected,\u201d the complaint states, citing a Dec. 28 article in Global News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lead plaintiff Jodie Hejduk seeks to represent both a California class and a national class, though Meiselas says his office has been getting calls from people around the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe want Spin Master to stop the spin, be a responsible corporate citizen, and redress the damages to consumers, or it\u2019s headed to a jury of moms and dads, husbands and wives, who will decide whether the product was fraudulent. We think they will,\u201d Meiselas said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said he hopes the class action sends a message to other corporations \u201clooking to exploit the average consumer saving money to buy their kids a gift not to sell a defective product that hits Americans in the pocketbook.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hejduk, who snagged one of the coveted toys for her daughter\u2019s birthday, says her daughter was thrilled to get it, but \u201cdismayed\u201d when it never hatched, though she followed the instructions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other parents have written scathing reviews on Amazon.com and on the Toys R Us website. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master promised to address the issues, but the few remedial measures it took were ineffective, according to the 25-page complaint. Hejduk says the company should have recalled the toys or issued refunds, but it did neither. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master did not return emailed requests for comment on Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hejduk seeks class certification, a recall, restitution with interest, and compensatory, statutory and punitive damages for consumer law violations, unfair competition, false advertising, breach of warranty and unjust enrichment.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In its report, the team also concluded that while the site where the wreck was found \"is located in the general area where one would expect to find the Santa Maria based on contemporary accounts of Columbus's first voyage, it is further away from shore than one should expect\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A metal tube Mr Clifford had seen during a 2003 expedition and thought to be a lombard, or cannon, was no longer at the site, the experts said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'No trace' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Santa Maria was the flagship of Christopher Columbus's first voyage to the Americas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Documents from the time suggest it ran aground on a reef or sandbank off the northern shore of Haiti on the night of 24 to 25 December 1492. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to these historical sources, Columbus told his crew to strip timbers from the ship to build an outpost or fort nearby, leaving sailors behind while he returned to Spain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By the time Columbus returned the following year, the fort had been burned down and the crew members had disappeared. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The wreck of the Santa Maria was never found. The Unesco experts said it could have been buried by sediment over the past centuries or have been slowly worn down by the waves.\nPassage 2:\nThe initiative has been triggered by the underwater exploration work carried out off the north coast of Haiti by the American explorer Barry Clifford, who announced in May that he had discovered what might be Columbus' long-lost vessel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unesco \u2013 which has now examined Clifford\u2019s wreck \u2013 believes that it is not the Santa Maria, but that the real final resting place of Columbus' flagship could be relatively nearby. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Paris-based organization now plans to look for the Santa Maria in a number of different locations \u2013 some on land and others on the seabed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both the nature of Unesco\u2019s outright rejection of Clifford\u2019s site, and some of the organisation\u2019s proposed alternatives, are likely to prove controversial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An official Unesco report issued today largely ignores 11-year-old photographic evidence for what could be Columbus-era cannon on the site. The cannon have tragically been looted since the photographs were taken but some of the world\u2019s top experts in early ordnance who have looked at the photos believe that they are 15th or 16th century weapons, sometimes known as lombards. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report also ignores crucial evidence from an expedition which almost certainly visited the site in 1960. It also admits that no tests, which could have revealed the geographical origin of the vessel, have been carried out on the ballast from the wreck. Likewise no detailed analysis has been carried out on the bronze objects found on the site \u2013 tests which might have revealed the objects\u2019 ages. Neither does the report really assess in any detail the case for there potentially being two wrecks, one early and one later, on the site, rather than just one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bronze items \u2013 a number of ship construction fasteners \u2013 is the main reason for rejecting it as the Santa Maria. Unesco says that ship construction fasteners only came into use in the late 17th century, a belief based mainly on the fact that such fasteners have apparently not been found so far on earlier wrecks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Very significantly, Unesco also seems to have moved towards the belief that the Santa Maria may be buried under sediments on what used to be seabed and is now coastal marshland. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many scholars are likely to be very critical of any plan Unesco has to look for the Santa Maria in those marshes, because, they argue, Columbus's vessel could not have reached them due to some shallow and dangerous reefs. Unesco\u2019s only argument for looking on land, and one of only two arguments for rejecting Mr Clifford\u2019s site, is a short very ambiguous passage in an edited version of Columbus\u2019 diary. Sadly only edited versions survive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unesco seems to think that the remains of the Santa Maria could be buried in one of two areas of marshland along the North coast of Haiti, near the small town of En Bas Saline, or alternatively near La Petite Anse. The official Unesco report says that \u201cthe Santa Maria might indeed now\u201d lie \u201cunder coastal sediment\u201d. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A painting of the \u2018Santa Maria\u2019 caught in a storm off the coast of Hispaniola in 1492 (Alamy) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It added: \u201cTo better estimate the location of the wreck of the Santa Maria, it will be important to understand more precisely the geomorphological evolution of the coastline.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Unesco report may also have implications for the US public\u2019s perception of the organisation; America\u2019s relationship with Unesco is currently very poor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States has refused to pay its set financial contribution to Unesco for the past three years \u2013 and last year the organisation stripped America of its Unesco voting rights. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Santa Maria saga could potentially further damage relations, or at least public attitudes, because a senior US underwater archaeologist, Professor Charles Beeker of Indiana University, who had been conducting a preliminary investigation of the site earlier this year at the request of Barry Clifford, has been refused permission to continue his work. What was in effect a US-led investigation has been more or less killed off by Unesco, and replaced by a partly European team. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unesco has officially advised the Haitian government against accepting the US archaeological team\u2019s proposal because \u201cin its current state\u201d it \u201clacked many elements required for the appropriate underwater archaeological research on the concerned site\u201d, and because it \u201cdid not conform\" to the organisation's standards on the protection of underwater cultural heritage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Santa Maria was the flagship of Christopher Columbus\u2019 three-vessel fleet which discovered the New World. The fleet first reached the Americas on 12 October 1492 when they sighted the Bahamas. 75 days later, at around midnight, while Columbus was asleep, the Santa Maria drifted onto a reef and could not be refloated. Within a few hours the ship\u2019s seams began to open \u2013 and the interior of the vessel was flooded.

Columbus then established a fort, left a garrison of 39 men there, and returned to report his discoveries to the King and Queen of Spain. Later in 1493, he returned to his fort in Haiti \u2013 but it had been destroyed and the garrison had all died or been killed.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI think that Mr. Clifford\u2019s site is still the best candidate yet proposed for the wreck of the Santa Maria,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not saying that it is definitely Columbus\u2019 flagship, but without a more thorough and comprehensive investigation, the site cannot be discounted.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cBut even if it ultimately turns out not to be the right site, all the historical and other evidence points to the vessel having been wrecked in that immediate area \u2013 certainly within just a few hundred metres of Clifford\u2019s site. Unfortunately Unesco\u2019s ideas as to where the wreck of the Santa Maria may lie are extremely flawed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cTheir suggestion that it could lie on what is now land is not consistent with contemporary accounts suggesting the wreck\u2019s considerable distance from the shore. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIn my view it would have been impossible for the Santa Maria to drift onto what is now land \u2013 because the vessel would have been wrecked on the reef before getting that far, which is precisely what happened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe bronze fasteners are a puzzle \u2013 but not sufficient reason on their own to dismiss the site without detailed investigation. There are a number of possible explanations for the presence of those bronze objects.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cMr Clifford has triggered very substantial renewed international interest in finding Columbus\u2019 lost flagship \u2013 a vessel which represented the start of continuous contact between the old and new worlds, and one if not the most important event in world history.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reacting to the Unesco report, Mr Clifford, said: \u201cIt is essential that Unesco investigates the entire area where the lombard cannons were.

As predicted by authorities in Haiti, UNESCO experts say there is \"indisputable proof\" that the wreck found off the country's north coast is from a much later period than 1492, reports the BBC. UNESCO says the wreck is further from shore than accounts of Columbus' first voyage, and bronze or copper fasteners found at the site are evidence of shipbuilding techniques that date the ship to the late 17th or 18th century at the earliest. UNESCO says it believes the wreck may lie \"under coastal sediment\" in what is now marshland and has called for further investigation of the area. Marine archaeologist Barry Clifford, who first investigated the wreck 11 years ago, says Columbus-era lombard cannons spotted in the area are crucial pieces of evidence that now appear to have been looted from the site, the Independent reports. \"The lombards are the smoking guns and, in my view, the most important pieces of evidence in the search for the Santa Maria,\" he says.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Russia\u2019s election hacking was raised during the meeting, but it does not appear to have taken top billing. US secretary of state Rex Tillerson said Trump was \u201crightly focused on how do we move forward\u201d from the issue, while Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov even claimed Trump had told Putin he accepted the Russian leader\u2019s denials of involvement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Setting up a working group on non-interference in future elections \u2013 as Tillerson said had been agreed \u2013 is hardly likely to reassure those in Washington worried about Russia\u2019s actions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A trustworthy account of exactly how the meeting went down is unlikely to surface: another win for Putin was the makeup of the room. In addition to the two presidents, the only people present were the respective foreign ministers and two translators. This means there is no chance of leaks, as happened when Lavrov visited the White House in May and it later emerged that Trump had shared sensitive intelligence with the Russians. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The personalised format of the meeting excluded those in Trump\u2019s team who are more sceptically minded on Russia, such as national security adviser HR McMaster, and Trump\u2019s senior Russia adviser Fiona Hill, a longstanding Russia expert. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Russian television emphasised the length of the meeting, which ran more than four times over its scheduled half-hour length, as a sign of Russia\u2019s importance. The news of a US-Russia agreement on a ceasefire in southwestern Syria, announced as the meeting was ongoing, is an example of the kind of top-table diplomacy Putin would like to do with Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Putin looked impassive, but he would have been smiling inside. As journalists were hurried out of the room, Putin appeared to gesture to Trump and ask if these journalists were the ones who had insulted Trump, laughing at his own joke.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump, who has angered world leaders with his decision to pull the United States out of the Paris accord on climate change, will likely have to leave that session early to make the Russia meeting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some fear the Republican president, a political novice whose team is still developing its Russia policy, will be less prepared for their sit-down than Putin, who has dealt with the last two U.S. presidents and scores of other world leaders.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The White House declined to offer details on what Trump would request of Putin and what he might offer in exchange for cooperation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Trump wanted to talk about how the two countries can work together to stabilize war-ravaged Syria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The United States is prepared to explore the possibility of establishing with Russia joint mechanisms for ensuring stability, including no-fly zones, on-the-ground ceasefire observers, and coordinated delivery of humanitarian assistance,\" Tillerson said before leaving the United States to join Trump in Germany.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After a two-month trial, the jury in the Casey Anthony murder trial announced they had arrived at a verdict. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony was found not guilty of first-degree murder and the other most serious charges against her in the 2008 death of her 2-year-old daughter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The nation was first introduced to Casey Anthony in July 2008. The country fell in love with her precious daughter, Caylee, who had gone missing in Orlando, Florida. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A massive missing persons search for the little girl ensued. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police were suspicious of what Anthony, then 22, was telling them. She lied about her nanny taking the child. She lied about working at Universal Studios. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony suddenly became the most hated woman in America. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On July 16, 2008, Anthony was arrested on suspicion of child neglect. Her attorney was an unknown Florida lawyer named Jose Baez. A Florida grand jury indicted Anthony on capital murder charges October 14, 2008. A utility worker found Caylee's skeletal remains in a wooded area near the Anthony home in December 2008, and several months later, prosecutors announced they would seek the death penalty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Florida v. Casey Anthony: A look back at evidence and testimony NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Watching in the wings was another Florida lawyer, Cheney Mason. A former president of the Florida Association of Criminal Lawyers, Mason, who just that year had been selected by Florida Monthly magazine as one of Florida's top lawyers, was disgusted with the local media coverage about the relatively inexperienced Baez. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I was offended by it. I was offended by the fact that he wasn't being treated fairly. I didn't know Baez. I had never met him,\" Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Baez started asking Mason, a Florida death penalty qualified attorney, for advice. That propelled Mason to want to meet Anthony. He remembers going to the Orange County jail to introduce himself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They brought her to the room, and I have to tell you I was really surprised to see how small she is ... how tiny she is. I stood looking at a child herself. I said this can't be,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I sat down with Mason exclusively to talk with him about his new book, \"Justice in America.\" In it, he insists that the jury got it right, and the rest of the country had it wrong. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Could she look you in the eye?\" I asked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Oh yes,\" Mason responded, describing her demeanor as quiet, afraid and unsure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After that meeting, with Anthony's approval, Mason decided to join the team pro bono. He said the unpaid time he spent on the case \"was well over a million dollars\" and cost him tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason said in the years before trial, he normally met with Anthony in a lunch room at the jail. The jail would clear everyone out before Anthony came in. A stationary video camera in the room was positioned on their conversations, so he and Anthony would cover their mouths and speak in low tones to each other, Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shortly before jury selection was to begin, Mason got word that Anthony's handwritten letters describing sexual abuse at the hands of her father were going to be made public under Florida's open records law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He believed it was only right that Anthony's parents, George and Cindy, were warned. He called them to his office late on a Friday afternoon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We had them one at a time come into my personal office and made the announcement: 'Monday's going to be a bad day for you George. I felt man to man I would tell you in advance.\"\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason said George Anthony's reaction was \"basically none.\" \"He looked at me ... I turned sideways a little bit, he clapped his hands down on his thighs -- let out a big sigh but didn't say anything,\" Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He never admitted doing anything,\" Mason said. \"All we had were the letters and (separately) the statements Casey had made to the psychiatrist.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Next it was Cindy Anthony's turn. \"We called Mom in, Cindy, and told her and she immediately welled up with emotion, cried, was very upset,\" Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once a jury was selected it was time for the evidentiary portion of the trial. Baez gave the opening statements. In the midst of telling the jury what the evidence would show, he delivered a bombshell that turned the case on its head by telling the jury that his client was a victim of sexual abuse by her father. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The country was stunned and so was Mason, who was sitting next to Anthony in the courtroom. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I didn't know that he was going to say that. We had talked about all aspects of it, and I did not know. I don't know if anybody knew that he was going to say that other than himself,\" Mason recalled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I asked Mason if he was concerned the defense would not be able to establish this with evidence as promised during the opening statement. Mason said he was. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Yes, I was concerned about that because I knew we didn't have the ability to prove that unless George got on the stand and confessed,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The prosecution responded by making George Anthony its first witness. The first question Assistant State Attorney Jeff Ashton asked him was whether he had sexually abused his daughter. George Anthony responded with a definitive no. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The trial went on for weeks. Witness after witness took the stand for the prosecution in the largely circumstantial case. They finally rested their case on June 15, 2011. Then it was the defense's turn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony's defense attorneys maintained that Caylee was not murdered at all. They said the child drowned in the Anthony's above-ground pool, and that Casey Anthony and her father panicked upon finding her there and covered up the death. George Anthony denied that in his testimony. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Casey Anthony: 'I didn't kill my daughter' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the midst of the defense case, Mason described how out-of-court conversations with the prosecution suddenly turned to possible plea discussions. Anthony was approached with the possibility. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Casey got very angry about that. She got very angry to hear talk about it. She didn't want to hear it.\" Mason said. \"Casey would fight it 'til her last breath. She didn't kill her daughter.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason said he believes it took a lot of courage and strength for Anthony to end any talk of a plea agreement. She knew what was at stake in this death penalty trial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So, plea discussions were stopped in their tracks, Mason said, and the trial went on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then, on July 5, 2011, after deliberating for 10 hours, jurors announced they had reached a verdict. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"She was holding her breath like a deep sea diver, waiting as we all were,\" Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony was acquitted by the 12-person jury on the most serious charges, including first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and aggravated manslaughter of a child. But the jury convicted her on four misdemeanors of providing false information to law enforcement officers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony now lives in an undisclosed location in Florida and doesn't go out of the home she is living in because of the public hate and continued threats to her life, Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"She has to live constantly on guard. She can't go out in public,\" Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By her own choice, she works inside the home, Mason said, and is living as \"a housekeeper, clerk, secretary and stuff like that.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think Casey has a lot of world left to have to deal with. She hasn't been freed from her incarceration yet 'cause she can't go out. She can't go to a beauty parlor, she can't go shopping to a department store, she can't go to a restaurant, she can't even go to McDonald's. She can't do anything,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason and his wife, Shirley, have continued a relationship with Anthony. Now three years after being acquitted, Mason said Anthony still distrusts the outside world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Casey is aloof,\" Mason said. \"She is kind of, I think, afraid of people ... she's not real close to. We've had a couple of occasions to have social gatherings that can include her -- close friends, the (legal) team. She still likes to back away from the middle.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2012: Anthony's 'video diary' surfaces NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony \"does not have any blood family anymore,\" Mason said. The family she has is the residual of the defense team, Dorothy Clay Sims, Lisabeth Fryer and Mason's wife. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason said although there may have been a few conversations between Anthony and her mother in recent years, there is no relationship. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And as for a relationship with her father? \"None,\" Mason said emphatically. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shirley Mason has also gotten to know Anthony over the past three years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm a cross between a friend, a mother, but not a mother -- only someone who is older who has had experience in the world she has not had,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason gives Anthony advice, but also listens to her when they talk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"My hope for her is it gets better for her and the world or the people who have been so hateful can let that go and they can move on,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony \"tries to make her life work,\" Shirley Mason said. She takes care of herself and stays physically fit by working out in the house. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I do think she wants to speak out,\" Mason said. Anthony declined CNN's request for an interview.

A third Olympian, Sydney bronze medalist Jamie Dantzscher, has also said she was abused by Nassar. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the Lansing State Journal, which is part of the USA TODAY Network, more than 140 women have alleged sexual abuse by Nassar, under the guise of medical treatment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nassar was the USA Gymnastics\u2019 team physician for nearly 20 years, beginning in 1996. He was fired by USA Gymnastics in the summer of 2015, but the federation waited five weeks before alerting the FBI.

The Indianapolis Star, also part of the USA TODAY Network, has reported more than 360 cases in which gymnasts have accused coaches of sexual transgressions over 20 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re the Olympic champion or you\u2019re an 8-year-old that goes to gymnastics in Ohio, or wherever you are in the United States,\u201d Raisman said in a joint interview with USA TODAY Sports and The Associated Press in August, when she and her Final Five teammates from Rio were inducted into the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cEvery single kid is important, and I want USA Gymnastics to do a better job with that.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Raisman declined to detail her interactions with Nassar during the August interview, saying she wanted to keep the focus on the scandal and its overall impact.

I want these young girls to know. It should have never ever happened and I think that needs to be discussed more.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last month, Maroney came forward in a Twitter post, saying Nassar abused her under the guise of medical treatment. Nassar abused her until she left the sport, Maroney wrote, adding, \"It seemed whenever and wherever this man could find the chance, I was 'treated.'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maroney said Nassar abused her before the U.S. team won gold in the 2012 Olympics and before she won silver on vault. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the 2011 world championships, Maroney said Nassar gave her a sleeping pill \"and the next thing I know I was all alone with him in his hotel room getting a 'treatment.' I thought I was going to die that night.\" She was 15 at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maroney shared her account in October with the #MeToo hashtag. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"People should know that this is not just happening in Hollywood,\" Maroney wrote. \"This is happening everywhere. Wherever there is a position of power, there seems to be potential for abuse. I had a dream to go to the Olympics, and the things that I had to endure to get there were unnecessary and disgusting.\"' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nassar pleaded guilty to federal child pornography charges in July, and he faces 22 to 27 years in prison when he\u2019s sentenced on Dec. 7. He also faces 33 charges of criminal sexual conduct in Michigan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sex abuse scandal led to the ouster of USA Gymnastics CEO Steve Penny, who resigned in March under pressure from the U.S. Olympic Committee. USA Gymnastics announced this week that Kerry Perry, formerly the vice president of business development at Learfield Communications, would start as CEO on Dec. 1. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR USA Gymnastics hired former federal prosecutor Deborah Daniels to review its practices, and her report found USA Gymnastics needed a \u201ccomplete cultural change\u201d so safety and well-being of athletes was a greater priority than world and Olympic medals.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think that, you just want, you want to trust people and that he was just a disgusting person, he took advantage of so many people's trust,\" Raisman told The Associated Press and USA Today Sports. \"And I think, it just disgusts me he was a doctor.

Because when a doctor says something you want to believe him and it's just awful.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR USA Gymnastics, in a statement to \"60 Minutes,\" said it was \"very sorry that any athlete has been harmed\" and that \"we want to work with Aly and all interested athletes to keep athletes safe.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than 140 women are now suing Nassar and his former employer, Michigan State University. The plaintiffs are also suing USA Gymnastics and other defendants. Attorneys for the alleged victims, USA Gymnastics, the school and other parties to the lawsuit are engaged in court-ordered mediation in an effort to reach a settlement. Attorneys have said that more women are expected to join the lawsuits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is not known whether Raisman or Maroney are part of those lawsuits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nassar has already pleaded guilty to federal child pornography charges and is in jail, awaiting a Dec. 7 sentencing in that case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also faces charges in state court in Michigan, largely related to allegations that he digitally penetrated women during medical exams for his own sexual gratification. If convicted on any one of the 22 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, Nassar could be sentenced to life in prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the past, Nassar and his attorneys have defended the intra-vaginal and intra-rectal procedures as accepted medical practice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nassar was a trainer with USA Gymnastics as far back as 1986. In 1996, he was named national medical coordinator, a position he held until the summer of 2015. Nassar resigned his position from USA Gymnastics shortly after concerns were raised about his behavior during medical exams. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR USA Gymnastics never informed Nassar's employer at the time, Michigan State University, about the circumstances surrounding Nassar's resignation, and he continued to treat patients in Michigan until he was fired by the school in September 2016. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Raisman has called for change within the sport. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I am angry,\" Raisman told \"60 Minutes.\" \"I'm really upset because it's been -- I care a lot, you know, when I see these young girls that come up to me, and they ask for pictures or autographs, whatever it is, I just ...

I just want to create change so that they never, ever have to go through this.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Raisman has also called for sweeping changes in leadership, including the removal of the chairman of the board, Paul Parilla. USA Gymnastics hired Kerry Perry as its new president and CEO on Tuesday after president Steve Penny resigned in March after 12 years on the job. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Raisman and Maroney are the highest-profile gymnasts yet to come forward publicly claiming abuse by Nassar. Jamie Dantzscher, a bronze medalist on the 2000 U.S. Olympic team, was part of the initial wave of lawsuits filed against Nassar in 2016. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The list of Nassar's accusers also includes several former national team members. Jeanette Antolin, Jessica Howard and Kami MacKay have all come forward, alleging abuse by Nassar either through the filing of lawsuits or, in the case of MacKay, on social media. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR USA Gymnastics launched an independent review of its policies in the wake of the allegations against Nassar in the summer of 2016, following reporting by the Indianapolis Star that highlighted chronic mishandling of abuse allegations against coaches and staff at some of its more than 3,500 clubs across the country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In June, the federation immediately adopted 70 recommendations proffered by Deborah Daniels, a former federal prosecutor who oversaw the review. The new guidelines require member gyms to go to authorities immediately, with Daniels suggesting USA Gymnastics consider withholding membership from clubs that decline to do so. The organization also named Toby Stark, a child welfare advocate, as its director of SafeSport. Part of Stark's mandate is educating members on rules, educational programs, reporting and adjudication services.

Our Lady of Guadalupe, in Mexico, draws millions of fervent worshipers a year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, a little chapel among the dairy farms here, called Our Lady of Good Help, has joined that august company in terms of religious status, if not global fame. This month, it became one of only about a dozen sites worldwide, and the first in the United States, where apparitions of the Virgin Mary have been officially validated by the Roman Catholic Church. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1859, the year after Mary is said to have appeared in Lourdes, a Belgian immigrant here named Adele Brise said she was visited three times by Mary, who hovered between two trees in a bright light, clothed in dazzling white with a yellow sash around her waist and a crown of stars above her flowing blond locks. As instructed, Ms. Brise devoted her life to teaching Catholic beliefs to children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Dec. 8, after a two-year investigation by theologians who found no evidence of fraud or heresy and a long history of shrine-related conversions, cures and other signs of divine intervention, Bishop David L. Ricken of Green Bay declared \u201cwith moral certainty\u201d that Ms. Brise did indeed have encounters \u201cof a supernatural character\u201d that are \u201cworthy of belief.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lourdes-like hordes have not yet gathered, but since the weighty decree a growing stream of visitors, some driving several hours, has found its way here to pray and revel in what many say is the palpable presence of Mary. Calls are coming in from as far as New York from church groups that want to visit by the busload, and local church officials are wondering whether they thought too small when they built a new parking lot \u2014 planned well before this month \u2014 with 75 spaces. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Debbie Banda, 46, and her mother, Mary Young, 75, who live nearby, learned of the shrine and the bishop\u2019s decision from the news, and came for the first time on Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt\u2019s incredible \u2014 she\u2019s here, you just feel it,\u201d Ms. Banda said after praying in the crypt chapel, said to be on the spot of the apparitions. As they passed a statue of Mary in white, just as described by Ms. Brise, Ms. Banda was overcome with emotion, weeping and hugging her mother. The two of them went back to pray some more. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe need the Virgin Mary\u2019s protection, and for her to keep an eye on our soldiers, too,\u201d said Ms. Young, whose sons have served in the Middle East. \u201cWe\u2019ll definitely be coming back.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Catholic leaders described the decree in Wisconsin as a bolt of joy at a trying time for the Catholic church, which is troubled by revelations of sex abuse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThis is a gift to the believers,\u201d said the Rev. Johann Roten, director of the International Marian Research Institute at the University of Dayton. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt would be devious to say that this was somehow pulled out of the attic to exorcise the problems of the church today,\u201d Father Roten said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut hopefully this will have a beneficial impact on the people, showing them that there are ways of living with faith that are very pure.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Diocese of Green Bay is under fire from lawyers in an abuse-related lawsuit, who charge that it has obstructed justice by destroying potentially incriminating files on former priests. The diocese says it has cooperated fully with law enforcement and discarded psychiatric records of deceased priests as required by federal privacy laws. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bishop Ricken, in an interview at his office in Green Bay, noted that the church has a tradition of taking its time with such cases. Over the years, he said, his predecessors had implicitly endorsed the shrine by holding services there and encouraging people to visit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When he moved to Green Bay in 2008, he said, \u201cI was struck by how many stories I heard of answered prayers\u201d \u2014 resolved family and employment problems as well as medical cures \u2014 and he decided to start a formal investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cPeople have a hunger for the spiritual, and right here in our backyard was a source to meet that need,\u201d Bishop Ricken said. The church\u2019s scandals did not influence his decision, he said, but if the shrine can become a source of hope and healing for people, including victims of errant priests, \u201cthat would be beautiful.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Vatican gives primary responsibility for evaluating apparitions to local bishops. Wary of fraud, the church is generally reluctant even to investigate claims. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the 20th century, some 386 major apparitions of Mary were reported at a level beyond local rumors, said Father Roten, who has been an investigator in purported sightings. About 75 of those were studied, and at most a dozen were recognized as valid, he said. Increasingly, he said, the church makes use of psychiatric examinations and brain scans to see if people making claims are mentally healthy and not having hallucinations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That kind of examination was not possible, of course, for Ms. Brise, and Bishop Ricken said that his panel of three theological specialists had considered a host of indirect factors in concluding that her sighting was credible, following guidelines set by the Vatican in 1978. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By all reports, he said, Ms. Brise was humble and honest and faithfully carried out Mary\u2019s mandate to serve the church throughout her life. In one striking sign of a divine presence, he said, the shrine\u2019s grounds and the terrified crowd who gathered there were spared the flames of the Great Peshtigo Fire of 1871, which devoured the surrounding lands and homes and caused more than 1,200 deaths. Her account of Mary\u2019s apparition and message was consistent with accepted cases. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The dozens of families and individuals who stopped to pray at the shrine on Wednesday afternoon seemed to have no doubts at all about the apparitions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of power here,\u201d said Theresa Vandermause, 45, who for years has made a weekly pilgrimage to the shrine with her friend Judy Deprey, 65. \u201cYou can feel the presence of Mary, and it feels like she\u2019s listening to you.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two women were pleased that the church had finally declared Mary\u2019s visits here to be real, but said that the decree had not really changed anything. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe knew that already!\u201d they declared.\nPassage 2:\nIn 1859 our Holy Mother, the Blessed Virgin Mary, visited the young woman, Adele Brise. It was an unlikely visitation to a simple, humble country girl on a dirt road in the wooded countryside. Her instruction was seemingly simple but required the commitment of Adele\u2019s life\u2019s work: teach the children in the faith. When we pause to think about this, it is very profound. The Holy Mother did not appear in a crowded city or to people of wealth and power. Instead, she appeared to an unlikely person in an unlikely place. In doing so, she made it clear to all the world that there is no one anywhere who is beyond the reach of God\u2019s generous love. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is good news. And now it is both our obligation and privilege to pay it forward by celebrating that visit and opening that message to anyone and everyone who answers the call.

In all, nine women in Sweden have received new wombs since 2012, but two had to have them removed because of complications. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The women received wombs donated by their mothers or other close relatives in an experimental procedure designed to test whether it's possible to transfer a uterus so a woman can give birth to her own biological child. The women had in vitro fertilization before the transplants, using their own eggs to make embryos. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have already begun transferring embryos into four of the women and plan to make attempts with the others when they are ready,\" said Dr. Mats Brannstrom, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Goteburg, who is leading the research.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mark Udall, a champion of government transparency, urged the president today to publicly support the fullest declassification possible of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's exhaustive study of the CIA's detention and interrogation program. Udall, who serves on the committee, said anything less will not set the record straight on this dark chapter of the CIA's history. Udall also said without significant progress on his previous requests and on removing obstacles to committee oversight of the CIA's detention and interrogation program, he will be unable to support advancing Caroline Krass's nomination to be CIA general counsel.\nPassage 2:\n\u2014 The CIA Inspector General\u0092s Office has asked the Justice Department to investigate allegations of malfeasance at the spy agency in connection with a yet-to-be released Senate Intelligence Committee report into the CIA\u0092s secret detention and interrogation program, McClatchy has learned. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The criminal referral may be related to what several knowledgeable people said was CIA monitoring of computers used by Senate aides to prepare the study. The monitoring may have violated an agreement between the committee and the agency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The development marks an unprecedented breakdown in relations between the CIA and its congressional overseers amid an extraordinary closed-door battle over the 6,300-page report on the agency\u0092s use of waterboarding and harsh interrogation techniques on suspected terrorists held in secret overseas prisons. The report is said to be a searing indictment of the program. The CIA has disputed some of the reports findings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR White House officials have closely tracked the bitter struggle, a McClatchy investigation has found. But they haven\u0092t directly intervened, perhaps because they are embroiled in their own feud with the committee, resisting surrendering top-secret documents that the CIA asserted were covered by executive privilege and sent to the White House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McClatchy\u0092s findings are based on information found in official documents and provided by people with knowledge of the dispute being fought in the seventh-floor executive offices of the CIA\u0092s headquarters in Langley, Va., and the committee\u0092s high-security work spaces on Capitol Hill. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The people who spoke to McClatchy asked not to be identified because the feud involves highly classified matters and carries enormous consequences for congressional oversight over the executive branch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The CIA and the committee declined to comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, declined to discuss the matter and referred questions to the CIA and the Justice Department. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In question now is whether any part of the committee\u0092s report, which took some four years to compose and cost $40 million, will ever see the light of day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report details how the CIA misled the Bush administration and Congress about the use of interrogation techniques that many experts consider torture, according to public statements by committee members. It also shows, members have said, how the techniques didn\u0092t provide the intelligence that led the CIA to the hideout in Pakistan where Osama bin Laden was killed in a 2011 raid by Navy SEALs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The committee determined earlier this year that the CIA monitored computers \u0096 in possible violation of an agreement against doing so \u0096 that the agency had provided to intelligence committee staff in a secure room at CIA headquarters that the agency insisted they use to review millions of pages of top-secret reports, cables and other documents, according to people with knowledge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, a panel member, apparently was referring to the monitoring when he asked CIA Director John Brennan at a Jan. 29 hearing if provisions of the Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act \u0093apply to the CIA? Seems to me that\u0092s a yes or no answer.\u0094 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brennan replied that he\u0092d have to get back to Wyden after looking into \u0093what the act actually calls for and it\u0092s applicability to CIA\u0092s authorities.\u0094 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The law makes it a criminal act for someone to intentionally access a computer without authorization or to go beyond what they\u0092re allowed to access. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People familiar with the issue said it wasn\u0092t clear whether the monitoring violated any law or administrative regulations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., who has led calls for the CIA to allow the release of the report, also appeared to be referring to the monitoring in a letter he sent Tuesday to President Barack Obama. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u0093As you are aware, the CIA has recently taken unprecedented action against the committee in relation to the internal CIA review and I find these actions to be incredibly troubling for the committee\u0092s oversight responsibilities and for our democracy,\u0094 Udall wrote. \u0093It is essential that the committee be able to do its oversight work \u0096 consistent with our constitutional principle of the separation of powers \u0096 without the CIA posing impediments or obstacles as it is today.\u0094 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Udall also called on Obama to strip the CIA of control over how much of the Senate report should be made public. The report remains classified nearly 15 months after the panel approved the document and turned it over to the agency for vetting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u0093It is my belief that the declassification of the Committee Study is of paramount importance and that decisions about what should or should not be declassified regarding this issue should not be delegated to the CIA, but directly handled by the White House,\u0094 Udall wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Udall has led a handful of lawmakers in pressing for the release of the report\u0092s conclusions, which committee members have publicly said show that the CIA misled the Bush administration and Congress about the intelligence gained from using water-boarding and other interrogation techniques. On Tuesday, Hayden said \u0093For some time, the White House has made clear to the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that a summary of the findings and conclusions of the final report should be declassified, with any appropriate redactions necessary to protect national security.\u0094 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The conflict over the committee\u0092s investigation heightened late last year when the committee discovered that a CIA internal review confirming some of the committee\u0092s findings had been withheld from Senate investigators. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his letter to Obama, Udall said the internal report not only corroborates aspects of the committee\u0092s investigation, but \u0093acknowledges significant mistakes and errors made during the course of the CIA program.\u0094 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u0093It is vital that we understand how and why the content of the CIA\u0092s internal review contradicts the CIA\u0092s official June 27, 2013, response to the Committee,\u0094 he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The agency has downplayed the importance of the document, characterizing it as a compilation of summaries of classified documents, rather than an analytical report.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 90-year-old prince was recovering from having a coronary stent put in after doctors determined the heart pains that sent him to the hospital on Friday were caused by a blocked artery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Buckingham Palace said \"he's in good spirits\" and family members will visit Philip, also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, in the hospital after lunch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The royal family's Christmas schedule kicked off with a traditional morning service at St. Mary Magdelene Church, on the queen's sprawling Sandringham estate in Norfolk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The huge crowds that gathered outside the church got an early peek when the royals made a quick private visit to the church ahead of the services. Less than two hours later, they were back _ in different clothes _ for the Christmas service. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Queen arrived first _ dressed in a lavender-colored coat and hat _ in a royal limousine, leading the way into the church. Her oldest son, Prince Charles, and his wife, Camilla, trailed behind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prince Harry walked in with his brother William and new sister-in-law Kate_ now known as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Kate, whose style is closely watched around the world and who sends any dress she wears flying off the shelves in Britain, wore an eggplant-colored coat and matching hat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the other royals present was the queen's granddaughter, Zara Philips, who was joined by her new husband Mike Tindall, an English rugby player. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the service, children lined up to give bouquets of flowers to the queen. Thanking each well-wisher, the queen then handed the bouquets to her granddaughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Well-wisher Camilla Fitt, 71, said Charles told her that his father, Philip, was \"very determined\" to get well.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There's life in the old bugger yet. And, as always, plenty of death. After the Alien series looked as though it had hit the rocks creatively (not for the first time) with the last entry, Prometheus, five years ago, savvy old master Ridley Scott has resuscitated it, and then some, with Alien: Covenant, the most satisfying entry in the six-films-and-counting franchise since the first two. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gripping through its full two hours and spiked with some real surprises, this beautifully made sci-fi thriller will immeasurably boost fan interest in the run of prequels which Scott has recently said will consist of at least two more films until the action catches up to the 1979 original. This Fox release is a lock for major early summer box-office worldwide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Is there a director who has ever been artistically committed to a franchise as long as Scott has to the Alien series? None comes to mind (Steven Spielberg made his first Indiana Jones adventure, Raiders of the Lost Ark, in 1981, two years after Alien was released). It's a matter of record that Scott will turn 80 later this year, and Clint Eastwood will be 87 when he starts his new film; from the evidence on the screen, 80 may well be the new 50 where some top helmers are concerned, especially those who, like Scott and Eastwood, make a new film almost every year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It also helped to recruit a couple of very good writers, John Logan and Dante Harper, to dig the series out of its hole. No matter that these aliens have been around far longer than most of the viewers who will see this film opening weekend have been alive; this entry feels vital, freshly thought out and keen to keep us on our toes right up to the concluding scene, which leaves the audience with such a great reveal that it makes you want to see the next installment tomorrow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The elegantly spare opening, in which a \u201csynthetic,\u201d Walter (Michael Fassbender), engages his \u201cfather\u201d (an uncredited Guy Pearce) in a pointedly philosophical conversation, simply and effectively frames the thrust of the film's central interest in human life's origins and its prospects for survival. Casual viewers may assume that Walter is the same character Fassbender played in Prometheus. But, no, Walter, who sports an American, not British, accent, is an updated version of that all-purpose butler, factotum and technical wizard \u2014 a far friendlier iteration of the know-it-all computer Hal in 2001: A Space Odyssey. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And as in 2001, Alien: Covenant involves a long outer space voyage during which the 2,000 human passengers, along with 1,140 embryos, will linger in a deep-freeze sleep for several years while the humanoid plays watchdog. The giant ship, called Covenant, is headed for a very distant planet, Origae-6, which is considered a promising new home for humanity to settle. For this reason, not only the slumbering immigrants, but the crew, too, are composed of prospective parents meant to propagate and establish a new homeland for homo sapiens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This couples-only orientation lends a fresh feel to this group of space travelers, and definitely cranks up the emotional distress quotient as partners start splitting open and giving birth to the wrong kind of offspring. When a space storm hits and damages the ship's giant wind sails, the first to perish is the ship's captain (James Franco, seen ever-so-briefly), which devastates his mate Daniels (Katherine Waterston), assigned to oversee terraforming on humankind's new planet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This accident promotes second-in-command Christopher (Billy Crudup) to run the show, but he's portrayed from the outset as uncertain and lacking in confidence; more than that, he's a \u201cperson of faith,\u201d which puts him at great philosophical odds with most of the others. Unfortunately, once this element is introduced, the writers don't do much with it, so it feels like a missed opportunity to engage in some pithy religion vs. science debate. Worse, the character's overriding weakness as a man won't go over too well with faith-based audiences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not only that, but when the crew discovers a nearby \u201chidden planet\u201d that seems potentially compatible to human life, it's Christopher who makes the fateful decision to land there rather than to continue with their seven-year-long voyage. Farris (Amy Seimetz), the flier wife of the Covenant's main pilot Tennessee (Danny McBride), goes down for a peek and it looks pretty darn good, just like New Zealand, in fact, where half the world wants to move to right now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But as inviting as are the beautiful landscapes, mountains and lakes, there's trouble lurking in the magnificent flora and fauna and, given the particulars of this bloody franchise, it doesn't take long for humans to fall ill and start bursting with nasty and ferocious critters they never imagined could spring from their innards. This is not the sort of propagation the earthlings had in mind when they set off. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a brilliant stroke, the voyagers also encounter David, Walter's double, the very same \u201csynthetic\u201d who co-starred in Prometheus. Distinguishable from his supposedly new and improved relative by virtue of his long hair and British accent, this lone survivor of the previous voyage, who lives among the ruins of a great civilization wiped out by the aliens, gives Fassbender the delicious opportunity of a double performance. The actor makes the most of it, subtly delineating two nearly identical characters as they enact a contest for dominance, the details of which touch in clear but unpretentious ways on the notion of playing God. What goes down between the two remains uncertain right up to the fabulously diabolical twist ending. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scott and the writers have achieved an outstanding balance in Alien: Covenant among numerous different elements: Intelligent speculation and textbook sci-fi presumptions, startlingly inventive action and audience-pleasing old standbys, philosophical considerations and inescapable genre conventions, intense visual splendor and gore at its most grisly. The drama flows gorgeously and, unlike in many other franchises in which entries keep getting longer every time out, this one is served up without an ounce of fat. It provides all the tension and action the mainstream audience could want, along with a good deal more. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stylistically, the film is a thing of cool beauty, with superb effects and a lovely score. Creatively, it's a major reset on a level with the series' best.

( Mark Rogers / Twentieth Century Fox ) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Starring Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup, Danny McBride, Demian Bichir and Carmen Ejogo. Directed by Ridley Scott. Opens Friday in major theatres. 122 minutes. 18A The cast keeps expanding and the critters keep evolving, but there\u2019s one constant to Ridley Scott\u2019s Alien series. It\u2019s the horrific fear of personal invasion, by something that\u2019s about to leap up and latch onto you, causing unimaginable mayhem. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Article Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alien: Covenant has this dread in abundance. It ranks among the better chapters of a sci-fi horror franchise that began with the original Alien in 1979. Scott knows he dropped the ball with Prometheus, the erstwhile Alien prequel he foisted onto the unhappy masses in 2012. It barely showed the infamous beasties, choosing instead to batter senses with windy dialogue and events that seemed to betray basic elements of this decades-long saga. Alien: Covenant brings back the visceral panic that fans expect from the franchise, along with the show-stopping title creatures: among them the face-hugger, the chest-burster and the canoe-headed xenomorph of artist H.R. Giger\u2019s terrifying imagination. They\u2019re waiting to greet the unsuspecting crew of the spaceship Covenant, who have travelled to the far reaches of the galaxy in search of an Earthlike planet to colonize. (The most terrifying thing of all, barely acknowledged, is the thought of what must have happened to Earth if large-scale evacuations are underway.) The Covenant carries 2,000 passengers and 1,140 human embryos, all frozen in cryogenic deep sleep and with an emphasis on preserving couples and families as they make the years-long journey to a planet called Origae-6. Something happens that interrupts the journey and prompts the exploration of an unknown closer planet that looks to be every bit as inviting \u2014 until events prove that theory disastrously wrong. Scott and screenwriters John Logan (Spectre) and Dante Harper tidy up loose ends from Prometheus, making a much better story of the gods vs. men vs. machines ideas that director Scott has being exploring for decades, with Alien and also with Blade Runner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In so doing, they revive a moribund franchise in much the same way The Force Awakens reignited the Star Wars saga, by reconjuring characters and themes from the past. It won\u2019t take you long to figure out who the \u201cRipley\u201d character is here, for example, and the perilous planet narrative dates right back to the original Alien, and indeed to the dawn of sci-fi moviemaking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Article Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This might make the film seem too derivative for some. But for those willing to embrace the retro elements \u2014 count me among them \u2014 it works like gangbusters. And a story like this can\u2019t get by on terror alone. It also needs good actors to put it across, and Alien: Covenant more than delivers on that score. Michael Fassbender reprises his android character David from Prometheus, but this mechanical man acquires deeper intrigue when he\u2019s matched against his factory double, an upgraded model named Walter, also played by Fassbender. This is a grand performance times two that demands to be remembered at awards time. Other standouts from the brilliant cast are Katherine Waterston as fearless scientist Daniels, Danny McBride as good ol\u2019 boy pilot Tennessee and Billy Crudup as tragically promoted second-in-command Christopher, a weak man who assumes authority at exactly the wrong time. (Watch also for cameos from Guy Pearce and James Franco, as they help connect the dots between Prometheus and Alien: Covenant.) Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski and composer Jed Kurzel skilfully combine to boost the film\u2019s fear of the unknown. They make the remote New Zealand shooting locale look and sound both like the verdant paradise the mystery planet is thought to be and the brutal hellhole it actually is. Franchise films very often disappoint, especially as later instalments run out of fresh ideas. Not so Alien: Covenant, which breaks new ground even while revisiting old concepts. It leaves us seriously wondering what will happen next, but I can\u2019t tell you more or you\u2019ll yell \u2014 not only on Earth, but maybe also in space, where no one can hear you scream.\n", "answers": ["A spaceship arrives on a distant planet that looks like a perfect new home for humans in Alien: Covenant. But if you know anything about Alien movies, you'll know there's only terror in store. Here's what critics are saying about the latest installment of the franchise, with director Ridley Scott of 1979's Alien returning: The filmmakers have finally managed to \"dig the series out of its hole,\" Todd McCarthy puts it at the Hollywood Reporter. He calls Alien: Covenant \"the most satisfying entry in the six-films-and-counting franchise since the first two.\" Beautiful and gripping, it \"feels vital\" and is \"keen to keep us on our toes right up to the concluding scene, which leaves the audience with such a great reveal that it makes you want to see the next installment tomorrow.\" Peter Howell at the Toronto Star agrees this flick \"ranks among the better chapters\" of the franchise. Scott \"breaks new ground even while revisiting old concepts\" and \"brings back the visceral panic that fans expect.\" Actors Katherine Waterston, Danny McBride, Billy Crudup, and Michael Fassbender\u2014who delivers \"a grand performance times two\" as two separate robots\u2014also deserve high praise, he writes. The inclusion of Fassbender's David, from 2012's Prometheus, was an incredibly smart move, writes Joe Morgenstern at the Wall Street Journal. But there was little else that impressed him. There's just \"nothing new\" to this \"gore fest,\" he writes. He acknowledges, however, that \"many Alien fans will come looking for something old, and that's in bloodily abundant supply.\" Chris Klimek had his own issues with the film. For example, \"a religious subtext is introduced and then immediately abandoned,\" he writes at NPR. But he, too, had to marvel at Fassbender, whose \"existential rap session\" provides the \"freshest part of the movie.\" Then again, Fassbender's David \"is the only character in whom Scott seems truly interested,\" he writes."], "incorrect_answer": "Sorry, your context is too long to summarize."}, {"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nThroughout the race, Mr. Booker\u2019s three rivals \u2014 all serious political forces in New Jersey \u2014 struggled to shift the focus on their own qualifications, prompting increasingly direct attacks on Mr. Booker\u2019s record and business interests, including his ownership stake in an Internet start-up that had been created with financial backing of his powerful friends while he was in office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Booker\u2019s campaign pushed back hard against the attacks, saying there was nothing improper about his financial dealings and noting that he had given much of his income to charity and used his media appearances to focus attention on Newark. As he campaigned, he portrayed what his opponents saw as a weakness \u2014 that he was insufficiently liberal on issues important to Democrats like gun control and unions \u2014 as a strength. He argued that his pragmatic brand of politics, favoring practical solutions over ideology, had enabled him to lift the fortunes of Newark, the state\u2019s largest city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His message seemed to register with voters. Juan Valdes, a 38-year-old Palisades Park resident who voted for Mr. Booker, said that the mayor\u2019s record in Newark far outweighed any criticism his rivals had. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cYou can actually see the changes\u201d in Newark, he said outside a polling place. \u201cHow he turned Newark, of all places, around to where it is, I figured he could do some good for the rest of us.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Booker\u2019s political rise has been unconventional. After graduating from Yale Law School in 1997, he moved to Newark, where he lived in a housing project and became a community activist, making a successful bid for a City Council seat a year later. He positioned himself as an outsider, challenging the city\u2019s political establishment. In 2002, he ran against Sharpe James, the powerful Newark mayor who had been dogged by scandal. Mr. Booker lost that race, but four years later won his second bid for the office and later a second term. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Booker\u2019s public profile has always been much larger than would be expected for the mayor of a medium-size city. He is a regular on cable television shows, is in great demand on the speaking circuit and has long been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate. His ascension to the Senate would make him one of the most recognizable figures in a chamber known for its exclusivity.\nPassage 2:\nBy Matt Friedman and David Giambusso/The Star-Ledger NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWARK \u2014 Newark Mayor Cory Booker has easily prevailed in the Democratic U.S. Senate primary tonight, the Associated Press projects. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Booker will now face Steve Lonegan, the Republican primary winner, in the Oct. 16 special election to succeed the late Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Results show Booker well ahead of his three rivals tonight: U.S. Reps. Rush Holt (D-6th Dist.) and Frank Pallone (D-12th Dist.), and state Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex). The difference is so large \u2014 with Booker leading his closest opponent, Pallone, by a two-to-one margin \u2014 that the Associated Press called the race with just 7 percent of the vote in. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With 98 percent of the vote in, Booker leads Pallone 59 percent to 20, followed by Holt with 17 and Oliver with 4. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"In Washington, so many people focus on right and left,\" Booker said in his victory speech tonight in front of hundreds of supporters gathered outside the Prudential Center in Newark. \"Here in Newark, we're only concerned with one direction \u2014 and that is moving forward. Make me your Senator, and I will be unwavering in my focus in finding common ground.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I believe that this state will once again light the way forward for all of America,\" he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just after 8:40 p.m., when the primary was called for Booker, legendary hip-hop star Q-tip took the stage outside the arena. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The new Senator is wayyyyy ahead,\" Q Tip said in between a remix of The Jackson 5's \"I Want You Back.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 300 people were assembled on the plaza by 9 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Booker, 44, began the race as the frontrunner and never lost that status, raising far more money than his opponents and winning the backing of most of the state's Democratic organizations. His campaign also teamed up with South Jersey Democrats to get residents to cast their votes early by absentee ballot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I will be just like that twenty-something who came to Newark to represent people who couldn't afford fancy lawyers,\" Booker, a former city councilman, told the audience tonight. \"I will care about you. I will care about results for all of the people in New Jersey.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Booker spent much of the race ignoring his three Democratic rivals, instead portraying himself as able to work across the aisle and get results, as demonstrated by relationship with Republican Gov. Chris Christie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though Holt, Pallone and Oliver frequently went after Booker, their attacks gained little traction. His campaign hit its bumpiest patch in its final two weeks, when the New York Times raised questions about a tech company he founded, Waywire. It was not, however, enough to overcome his huge lead in the polls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tonight, Booker praised his three primary opponents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They are our champions, too,\" He said. \"We are no longer opponents. We are allies.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also had kind words for his new opponent, Lonegan, a conservative activist, the former mayor of Bogota, and an aggressive campaigner who has been blasting Booker for weeks already. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He is a person of strong beliefs and, I found already, even stronger rhetoric,\" Booker said. \"I will match his negative attacks with positive energy.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A rising star in the Democratic Party and a Republican former mayor won their parties' primaries on Tuesday to set up a campaign of political and stylistic contrasts as they seek to fill the final 15 months of the term of the late U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Newark Mayor Cory Booker defeated three experienced politicians _ U.S. Reps. Rush Holt and Frank Pallone, who had the support of Lautenberg's family, and state Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver _ in a Democratic primary that may have been more competitive had the field been less crowded. The race was a major draw for them partly because of New Jersey's history of electing only Democrats to the Senate over the past 40 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the Republican primary, former Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan won handily over Franklin Township physician Alieta Eck, who had never run for office before, even though she received support of some tea party organizations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The election is on a compressed schedule. The day after Lautenberg's death, Republican Gov. Chris Christie scheduled the primaries for Tuesday and a special election for Oct. 16, 20 days before the voting day on which he's seeking re-election. The move drew criticism, with some opponents saying Christie was spending $12 million on an extra election so he could avoid being on the same ballot as Booker, a claim Christie denies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Booker ran with the support of New Jersey's Democratic establishment and celebrities from across the country. Oprah Winfrey joined him at a fundraiser, and Eva Longoria campaigned with him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Booker is famous in the political world for his life story and his social media fanaticism: He has 1.4 million followers on Twitter, which he uses to field complaints about local issues such as sinkholes and to dispense inspirational quotes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He grew up in suburban Harrington Park, the son of some of the first black IBM executives, played football at Stanford, won a Rhodes scholarship, received a law degree from Yale, then moved into one of the toughest parts of Newark in an effort to revive the state's largest city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He is in his second term as mayor. In the city, reviews are mixed, but his narrative has helped make him well-known elsewhere. And he's leveraged that power to help bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in grant money for the city, including a $100 million pledge from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. He's also given 90 paid speeches across the country since 2008, collecting $1.3 million, nearly half of which he has donated to charity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lonegan, who stepped down from his job as state director of the anti-tax group Americans for Prosperity, focused his primary campaign on blasting Booker. He held a news conference to ridicule Booker's broad anti-childhood poverty plan and another at the scene of a homicide in Newark to question whether Booker has done much to reduce crime. He's also been to the New York headquarters of Waywire, a technology startup Booker co-founded, to criticize his role in it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For Booker, the new opponent means needing to gird himself for attacks from the right after spending an abbreviated primary campaign being criticized from the left by opponents. In debates, Booker found himself defending working with Christie, explaining that he disagrees with the governor \"90 percent of the time\" and promoting his conciliatory image. He also reaffirmed his support for using taxpayer money to send children to private schools, one of the few policy prescriptions on which he and Lonegan agree. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lonegan is a familiar voice in New Jersey politics, blunt and conservative. He ran in and lost gubernatorial primaries in 2005 and 2009. He was a leader of successful opposition to ballot measures that would have raised a state sales tax and funded stem-cell research. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like Booker, he grew up in suburban Bergen County, in Ridgefield Park, and played college football, at William Paterson. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both candidates also became better known through documentaries released in 2005. \"Anytown, U.S.A.\" looked at Lonegan's fiery re-election campaign in Bogota, and \"Street Fight\" chronicled Booker's first, and losing, run for mayor of Newark.\n", "answers": ["No contest: Cory Booker won the Democratic primary for a Senate seat in New Jersey so easily tonight that the AP called it just 45 minutes after the polls closed and with just 7% of returns in, reports the Star-Ledger.

At a hearing conducted last fall by a disciplinary panel established by the Canadian Judicial Council, the 19-year-old homeless complainant said Justice Camp\u2019s comment made her hate herself and feel like a slut.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By a vote of 19 to 4, the judicial council said in its ruling released on Thursday that the deep harm Justice Camp had done to public confidence made his dismissal necessary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe find that the Judge\u2019s conduct, viewed in its totality and in light of all of its consequences, was so manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of impartiality, integrity and independence of the judicial role that public confidence is sufficiently undermined to render the Judge incapable of executing the judicial office,\u201d the council said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All four dissenters, who found Judge Camp guilty of misconduct but opposed his dismissal, are male, and from the Atlantic provinces (one is Chief Justice of the Tax Court of Canada).

The woman was so drunk she had urinated on herself and passed out in the back seat.

Paradoxically, accumulation of AFP-stabilized ice could be lethal. Whether and how fishes eliminate internal ice is unknown; one hypothesis is that it melts during summer warming episodes. However, prior in vitro evidence indicates that AFPs also inhibit melting. Our study establishes that pronounced melting inhibition occurs in vivo (i.e., superheated ice occurs inside notothenioid fishes). Our long-term temperature record of a high-latitude Antarctic fish habitat indicates that summer warming does not overcome AFP-induced superheating to reliably rid fishes of ice. Evolution of the life-saving AFPs exacts a cost: the risk of lifelong accumulation of damaging internal ice crystals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abstract NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) of polar marine teleost fishes are widely recognized as an evolutionary innovation of vast adaptive value in that, by adsorbing to and inhibiting the growth of internalized environmental ice crystals, they prevent death by inoculative freezing. Paradoxically, systemic accumulation of AFP-stabilized ice could also be lethal. Whether or how fishes eliminate internal ice is unknown. To investigate if ice inside high-latitude Antarctic notothenioid fishes could melt seasonally, we measured its melting point and obtained a decadal temperature record from a shallow benthic fish habitat in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. We found that AFP-stabilized ice resists melting at temperatures above the expected equilibrium freezing/melting point (eqFMP), both in vitro and in vivo. Superheated ice was directly observed in notothenioid serum samples and in solutions of purified AFPs, and ice was found to persist inside live fishes at temperatures more than 1 \u00b0C above their eqFMP for at least 24 h, and at a lower temperature for at least several days. Field experiments confirmed that superheated ice occurs naturally inside wild fishes. Over the long-term record (1999\u20132012), seawater temperature surpassed the fish eqFMP in most summers, but never exceeded the highest temperature at which ice persisted inside experimental fishes. Thus, because of the effects of AFP-induced melting inhibition, summer warming may not reliably eliminate internal ice. Our results expose a potentially antagonistic pleiotropic effect of AFPs: beneficial freezing avoidance is accompanied by melting inhibition that may contribute to lifelong accumulation of detrimental internal ice crystals.\nPassage 2:\nEUGENE, Ore., Sept. 23 (UPI) -- Fish species that make their home in the frigid waters of Antarctica have developed special antifreeze proteins that keep their blood from icing over. But evolution is a strange game in which seemingly every adaptive trait comes with a trade-off, and for the fish of Antarctica that trade-off is quite the paradox. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the benefit of avoiding frozen blood, Antarctic notothenioid fish species must tolerate ice in their veins. That's right, the same antifreeze proteins that latch onto ice crystals and prevent them from growing also inhibit them from melting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A team of marine biologists discovered the odd trade-off while studying the coping mechanisms of notothenioid species living in supremely cold conditions. They discovered the antifreeze proteins' anti-melting properties after raising water temperatures slightly above the freezing point and still finding some ice in the blood of the fish specimens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We discovered what appears to be an undesirable consequence of the evolution of antifreeze proteins in Antarctic notothenioid fishes,\" study author Paul Cziko, a doctoral student the University of Oregon's Institute of Ecology and Evolution, said in a press release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If water temperature rises more than two or three degrees above the freezing point, these ice crystals are likely to melt. But Cziko and his colleagues at the University of Illinois found that ocean temperatures in the Antarctic rarely ever rose high enough to help clean the species icy veins. That means these fish carry ice crystals around with them for most of their lives -- a risky proposition that could help them stay cool under pressure but could also cause a life-threatening traffic jam inside small capillaries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Since much of the ice accumulates in the fishes' spleens, we think there may be a mechanism to clear the ice from the circulation,\" Cziko added. \"This is just one more piece in the puzzle of how notothenioids came to dominate the ocean around Antarctica.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday.\nPassage 3:\nScientists long have known that antifreeze proteins help a species of Antarctic fish survive in frigid waters. Now research has found that these proteins also prevent some fish from ever ridding themselves of the ice in their bodies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The notothenioid fish uses evolutionary mechanisms to survive in anchor ice that exists on the sea floors of the Antarctic region. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even after being studied for decades, the notothenioid, a bony fish that thrives in frigid waters, continues to hold surprises. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Notothenioids own the waters circling Antarctica known as the Southern Ocean; one of the few species that can survive in seawater temperatures as low as 29 degrees Fahrenheit, it makes up more than 90 percent of the fish biomass in the region. It's no wonder, then, that scientists began to investigate how these animals thrive in this icy environment without freezing over. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scientists have been revealing startling facts about the notothenioid for more than four decades now, including the discovery, in the 1960s, of antifreeze proteins inside these fishes, a vital tool for their survival. But according to a new study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers have revealed that these proteins may not be as helpful as they were once thought to be. The proteins do indeed help prevent water from freezing in the fish, but it turns out they also prevent ice from melting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've known for a long time that the antifreeze proteins are at the essence of how these fishes survive in their freezing environment. But we're still working out the details, and this is one of those details,\" Paul Cziko, lead author of the paper, told the Monitor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Cziko, a doctoral candidate at the University of Oregon, worked with Christina Cheng and Arthur DeVries, a husband-and-wife team of animal biologists at the University of Illinois. Devries revealed in the late 1960s that antifreeze proteins existed in the bodies of notothenioids. In the 1990s, he discovered that the fishes were also carrying ice crystals in various organs, such as the gills and the spleen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In this new study, Cziko's team tested fish in the lab by warming them to a point at which the ice in their bodies completely melted. These were temperatures, though, that the notothenioid never experiences in its own environment. They also examined temperature data logged continuously over the last 11 years in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The research group found that the ice crystals didn't melt at their expected melting point of about 30 degrees Fahrenheit, but instead remained intact. The fish continued to contain ice even after researchers raised the temperature further another 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, and this was primarily due to the antifreeze protein. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though the life-saving protein was given the name \"antifreeze,\" it works differently from, say, the liquid you mix with your windshield wiper fluid, according to Cziko. Rather than acting like a salt and lowering the freezing point, the notothenioids' antifreeze proteins bind themselves to the ice crystals in their bodies and alter the surface of the crystals so that they have a hard time growing any larger. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This mechanism doesn't just make it very hard for the ice crystals to grow, though. The proteins bind themselves so tightly that they also make it difficult for the ice to get any smaller, even in above-freezing temperatures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When people are studying antifreeze proteins they're looking at the ability of the organisms to deal with cold temperatures and not warm temperatures,\" says Cziko. \"All their focus is towards 'How much does it protect against freezing?' and people just kind of missed that there could also be an anti-melting effect that's important.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In controlled settings, scientists have been able to heat ice above its melting point without having the ice melt. But Cziko says this may be the first example of \"superheating\" found in nature. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So what does this superheated ice mean for the fish? Even in the slightly warmer summer months when the notothenioid has a chance to thaw out, some ice crystals linger. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whether or not there are any adverse effects on the fishes' bodies is still unknown. The long-term cost of having the protein, Cziko says, is a question for further research. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If they can tolerate it, maybe they've evolved some other mechanism to deal with these ice crystals inside their bodies,\" says Cziko. \"And maybe in the long-term it does kill the fish and they're not that good at dealing with it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The highest concentration of ice crystals resided in the fishes' spleens. Cziko says it's possible that the spleen is trying to filter these ice crystals out of the blood to prevent their causing problems in other parts of the body. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cziko also says research on this particular evolutionary puzzle provides us with a better understanding of the progression of all species. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" says Cziko \"Evolution is a stepwise process. You take two steps forward, and take one step back.\"\n", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice?

They didn\u2019t ask anything about him. He was a patient.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not long after treating Bowers, the young nurse broke down in tears. Cohen met with him for about 20 minutes and thanked him for doing his job. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cHe was pretty broken,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cI told him how proud I was. He went home and hugged his parents.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen, 63, lives about 50 yards from the Tree of Life Congregation where the mass shooting occurred. He was home on Saturday morning when he heard a loud noise outside. Within minutes, his daughter yelled to him to come downstairs and they watched as police and SWAT teams descended on their street. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He described the congregation as a safe place where people gather daily to pray and socialize.

Bowers had been wounded during a shoot-out with police. Two of the men who treated him at Allegheny General were themselves Jewish. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president of the hospital, Dr. Jeff Cohen, was a member of the Tree of Life synagogue. Cohen told the media last week that two of the people who treated Bowers were Jewish: the ER doctor, and a registered nurse. Cohen described Bowers as \u201clost\u201d and said that the registered nurse, a young man, broke down in tears after treating him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now the nurse has come forward with an emotional Facebook post about his experience treating Bowers. His name is Ari Mahler. Here\u2019s what you need to know: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1. Mahler Says Bowers Yelled \u2018Death to All Jews\u2019 as He Was Wheeled Into the Emergency Room NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler wrote that Robert Bowers didn\u2019t seem evil \u2014 instead, Mahler said, the alleged shooter seemed confused and lost. Mahler speculated that Bowers was a lonely, easily-led man who had been influenced by others. The nurse wrote, NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI didn\u2019t see evil when I looked into Robert Bowers\u2019 eyes. All I saw was a clear lack of depth, intelligence, and palpable amounts of confusion. Robert Bowers probably had no friends, was easily influenced by propaganda, and wanted attention on a sociopathic level. He\u2019s the kind of person that is easily manipulated by people with a microphone, a platform, and use fear for motivation.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler said that he never told Bowers that he was Jewish. He said he didn\u2019t want to go into detail about his interactions with Bowers, but he did say that the suspect thanked him for his kindness and for saving his life. Mahler wrote that he treated Bowers just the same way as he treats all of his patients. But he also wrote that, as Bowers was being wheeled into the emergency room, he yelled, \u201cDeath to all Jews!\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jeff Cohen, the president of Allegheny General Hospital, said that after Bowers\u2019 treatment Mahler came to him in tears, overwhelmed by what had just taken place. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2. Mahler\u2019s Father Is a Retired Rabbi NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler\u2019s father is Rabbi Mark Joel Mahler, who served as the rabbi of Temple Emanuel, a reform synagogue in South Hills, from 1980 until 2018. Rabbi Mahler retired in June of 2018. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The rabbi was known for his use of music; he played guitar and sang during Sabbath services, and he led the synagogue\u2019s band. Several of his children (not Ari) also participated in the band. Rabbi Mahler was also a member of the South Hills Interfaith Ministries and the National Conference of Christian and Jews. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rabbi Mahler and his wife Alice have four children: Ari, Shoshana, Moshe, and Shira. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3. Mahler Says He Often Experienced Anti-Semitism Growing Up NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ari Mahler wrote that he was not shocked by the Pittsburgh shooting; the Pittsburgh native says that anti-Semitism is nothing new for him. As a boy, he says, he often experienced bullying because he was Jewish. He described finding swastikas scrawled on his locker at school, or finding pictures of his family being sent to the gas chamber. And, Mahler writes, he never managed to confront the bullying head-on: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI experienced anti-Semitism a lot as a kid. It\u2019s hard for me to say if it was always a product of genuine hatred, or if kids with their own problems found a reason to single me out from others. Sure, there were a few Jewish kids at my school, but no one else had a father who was a Rabbi. I found drawings on desks of my family being marched into gas chambers, swastikas drawn on my locker, and notes shoved inside of it saying, \u201cDie Jew. Love, Hitler.\u201d It was a different time back then, where bullying was not monitored like it is now. I was weak, too. Rather than tell anyone, I hid behind fear. Telling on the people who did this would only lead to consequences far worse.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler also says that he developed defense mechanisms to shield himself from anti-Semites. He got into the habit of telling people that he isn\u2019t very religious. Mahler wrote that even people who view Judaism positively often seem to feel uncomfortable when they meet Jewish people. And so, he says, he\u2019s learned over the years how to ease awkward moments by deflecting attention from his Jewishness. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 4. Mahler Worked as a Financial Consultant Before Going to Work as a Nurse NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ari Mahler was an honors student at the University of Maryland, graduating in 1999 with a BA in English. Mahler went on to work as a loan officer for American Equity, and then as a financial consultant for PNC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then, in 2013, Mahler enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s School of Nursing, again earning honors and graduating the next year as a registered nurse. Mahler found work as a registered nurse at Magee Women\u2019s Hospital; he switched to working at Allegheny General in March of 2018. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 5. Mahler Concluded His Facebook Post With a Plea for Love in the Face of Evil NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler wrote movingly about his decision to treat Bowers with \u201ccompassion\u201d and \u201cempathy.\u201d He wrote that he never told Bowers that he was Jewish, and just treated him with the same care that he would use on any patient. He wrote, \u201cI wanted him to feel compassion. I chose to show him empathy. I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler wrapped up his Facebook post with a plea. He wrote, NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cLove as an action is more powerful than words, and love in the face of evil gives others hope. It demonstrates humanity. It reaffirms why we\u2019re all here. The meaning of life is to give meaning to life, and love is the ultimate force that connects all living beings. I could care less what Robert Bowers thinks, but you, the person reading this, love is the only message I wish to instill in you.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The harshness of the sentences and the scenes a day earlier were new signs that the military-backed government is becoming bolder in silencing dissent, turning to abuses reminiscent of the Hosni Mubarak era. Authorities have been justifying tougher measures as needed to fight terrorism and bring stability _ while they also appear to be exploiting divisions among secular democracy activists. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The crackdown is rearranging Egypt's political map after months when authorities were focused on crippling the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist backers of ousted President Mohammed Morsi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This week, security forces have moved against secular youth activists opposed to the military and police. Some government supporters warn that its actions are widening the base of the opposition and could bring together Morsi supporters and the secular activists, though they bitterly oppose the Islamists and Morsi as equally authoritarian. The crisis is fragmenting the loose coalition of liberal and secular groups that supported the military in its July 3 removal of Morsi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a Mediterranean city of Alexandria courtroom, the 21 young female defendants flashed defiant smiles to the media, standing handcuffed in white head scarves and white prison uniforms in the defendants cage. They were convicted on charges related to holding an Oct. 31 protest in the city demanding Morsi's reinstatement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among them were seven teenagers aged 15 and 16, who were sentenced to prison terms until they turn 18. The rest _ most aged 18 to 22 _ were sentenced to 11 years in prison. Six other Brotherhood members were sentenced to 15 years in prison for inciting the demonstrations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We thought they will get a month or something but we were shocked with the 11 years,\" defense lawyer al-Shimaa Ibrahim Saad said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Muslim Brotherhood's political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, said the sentences are meant to be a \"deterrent\" for the group's opposition to the military, vowing the verdict \"will only increase the determination of the people to get their rights.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, hundreds of secular youth activists protested Wednesday in downtown Cairo against the government's clampdown on dissent. At the center of the crisis is the law issued this week banning any protests or public political gatherings of more than 10 people without a prior police permit, imposing stiff fines and jail terms for violators. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Those thinking the authoritarian pharaonic style works will find it doesn't anymore,\" said one protester, Laila Soueif. \"There will be a third wave of the revolution much more violent than before. We are witnessing a turning point.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A day earlier, security forces broke up two small activists' protests in Cairo. Security forces beat and dragged women protesters outside parliament. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The images were reminiscent of the days of Mubarak, the autocrat who ruled the country for nearly 30 years and was ousted in a 2011 uprising. Under his rule, police at times focused on humiliating female protesters. Similarly, under the rule of the military that followed his ouster, police broke up an anti-military protest, half-stripping a female protester and stomping on her chest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After breaking up Tuesday's protest, police detained 14 women, then drove them in a van through the desert where they were dropped off on a remote road in the middle of the night, several of the women said. That too is a tactic used by Mubarak-era police to intimidate protesters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They want to terrorize us,\" said Mona Seif, a prominent activist who was among the 14 women. \"I think the interior minister decided to escalate and tell everyone whose family was killed... beaten or anything that I am here, this is how I do business, and if you don't like it, beat your head against the wall.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the face of the criticism, the Cabinet issued a strongly worded statement saying it is determined to implement the new protest law with \"all firmness and force ... so freedom doesn't turn to chaos.\" It linked it to a \"war on terrorism\" _ pointing to the Brotherhood protests and violence by Islamic militants in Sinai. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There are elements that want to spread domestic chaos in a desperate attempt to hurt the prestige of the state,\" it said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The law comes ahead of an election season that will include a referendum on amendments to the Islamist-drafted, Morsi-era constitution. Authorities have shown they are eager to push through the new charter _ but they could face troubles in the January vote on two fronts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Secular activists oppose the document because of wider powers it gives the military and the president. The Brotherhood rejects the entire amendment process _ along with the new government in general _ and although it has been weakened by a crackdown, it has kept up protests for over 20 weeks and can still mobilize against the document. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday, the prosecutor general's office ordered 24 people who were arrested in Tuesday's activist protest to be held for four days for questioning on possible charges of violating the protest law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a statement, the prosecutors office accused the protesters of \"chanting antagonistic slogans against the state\" and refusing to end their rally. It said the demonstration \"disturbed traffic and affected citizens' interests,\" terms mentioned in the protest law as violations justifying police action. It also accused them of attacking a police officer and taking his telephone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The prosecutor also ordered the arrests of Alaa Abdel-Fattah and Ahmed Maher, two top activists, on suspicion of inciting others to break the protest law, the state news agency MENA said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a sign of the Islamists' eagerness to find a common cause with secular activists, the Brotherhood-led coalition supporting Morsi reached out to them Wednesday with a statement denouncing \"brutal repression\" of the protests the day before, saying the \"youth of the revolution stand united.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The spokesman of the Muslim Brotherhood-led coalition, Diaa al-Sawi, said he will contact youth activists to coordinate rallies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They met a quick rejection, however, from the youth activists, who joined the massive anti-Morsi protests that preceded his ouster.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Monday, the widely discredited and dangerous anti-vaccination quack Andrew Wakefield tweeted: \u201cHaven\u2019t posted forever. Huge news tomorrow.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perhaps he hadn\u2019t \u201cposted forever\u201d because the media finally stopped giving him a megaphone. Perhaps once people in America and England began dying of measles, journalists finally realized that the \u201ctwo sides to every story\u201d approach granted Wakefield was literally killing people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last I heard, Wakefield was headlining Conspira-Sea, a seven-day cruise where passengers learn about crop circles, chemtrails, yogic flying, ESP and astrology. Good, I thought, that\u2019s where he belongs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Well, not so fast. It seems the quack is back. Wakefield\u2019s \u201chuge news\u201d is that he is now a documentary film director, and that his new film Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe will premiere at the prestigious Tribeca Film Festival this April. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Your film festival guide suggests that if I\u2019m interested in Vaxxed, I might also be interested in the category of \u201cdocumentaries.\u201d Well, as a documentary filmmaker who spent eight years making a film about a quack: yes, Tribeca Film Festival, I am very interested in both your choice to screen Vaxxed and in the field of documentary film. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I have always admired Tribeca\u2019s ambitious and broad documentary programming. I first saw (T)ERROR there, and The Genius of Marian, and Tomorrow We Disappear, and Thank You For Playing, and Give Up Tomorrow, and Let The Fire Burn \u2013 and so many other excellent films. And this is what makes your decision all the more pernicious: audiences have come to expect excellence from your documentary programming. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When The Los Angeles Times contacted you for comment, they received this response: \u201cTribeca, as most film festivals, is about dialogue and discussion. Over the years we have presented many films from opposing sides of an issue. We are a forum, not a judge.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here is the problem with your statement: it assumes that Vaxxed is just like any other film taking on an unpopular, controversial or provocative subject. It is not. There is a big difference between advocacy and fraud, between point of view and deception. For you to claim there is no difference helps to perpetuate Wakefield\u2019s fraud. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also, it is disingenuous for you to claim you are not a \u201cjudge.\u201d You are literally judging when you choose a film, from thousands of submissions, to screen under your banner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A lot of people, including those who buy tickets to see docs at your festival, believe documentary film has become a new and important form of news. But journalists are expected to tell the truth \u2014 or at least not knowingly spread dangerous lies. Your choice to include Vaxxed in your documentary lineup \u2014 a lineup including films about abortion, Syrian refugees, solitary confinement, the American electoral system, in-vitro fertilization and drone warfare \u2014 suggests that you think documentary filmmakers can\u2019t be held even to the latter standard. This threatens the credibility of not just the other filmmakers in your doc slate, but the field in general. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So yes, I take this personally. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While it is true that we documentary filmmakers constantly debate vexing questions about the perceived and real differences between our work and the work of traditional journalism, I assure you that we are not debating whether it is okay to knowingly spread dangerous lies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Consider how many lies there are in the first 30 seconds of the Vaxxed trailer. Wakefield\u2019s cinematic disregard of the truth means his film should not be called a documentary any more than Loose Change is. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In other words: issues around truth and ethics in documentary can get thorny. But this one is easy. This film is not some sort of disinterested investigation into the \u201cvaccines cause autism\u201d hoax; this film is directed by the person who perpetuated the hoax. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And this hoax isn\u2019t cute, or fun, or thought-provoking. Very possibly, some people will walk away from your festival having been convinced, in part because of your good name and the excellence and integrity of your documentary programming, not to vaccinate their children. And very possibly people will die as a result. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There\u2019s no shame in having been taken in by quack \u2013 the reason I made NUTS! is that I wanted to explore just how easy it is to fall for a quack, especially one cloaked in the authority of a documentary film. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I believe you were fooled in just this way: taken in by an apparently legitimate \u201cdocumentary\u201d film, a film which unethically used the tools of my trade toward bad ends. I believe you made a very serious (if human) mistake. But it\u2019s not too late to fix it. You can still apologize for your error and cancel the screening. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I know that some people will say I\u2019m advocating censorship when I say this. I appreciate that concern. The last thing I would want is for festivals to stop being bold, independent tastemakers afraid of controversy. And I would never suggest banning the film is some global sense (as if that were even possible!). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the problem is not that Vaxxed is controversial, or even that it\u2019s deceptive. Honestly, I consider a large number of well-made, popular documentary films fairly deceptive. The problem is that it is dangerous misinformation being legitimized under the banner of your considerable prestige. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Penny Lane (Our Nixon) is a two-time grantee of the Tribeca Film Institute whose most recent film, NUTS!

The accusations were flying. I don't know what it means to be a mom (I have 2 children). I obviously don't value the work that a mother does and how hard it is (the hardest job I have ever had); and I absolutely hate anyone who doesn't have the same views as I do (hate is a strong word). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spare me the faux anger from the right who view the issue of women's rights and advancement as a way to score political points. When it comes to supporting policies that would actually help women, their silence has been deafening. I don't need lectures from the RNC on supporting women and fighting to increase opportunities for women; I've been doing it my whole career. If they want to attack me and distract the public's attention away from their nominee's woeful record, it just demonstrates how much they just don't get it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR My favorite tweet was from someone who said that Republicans like Ann Romney so much more than Mitt that by attacking her (which I didn't), I got people to defend him in a way they never would. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That last one I can actually understand. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now let's be clear on one thing. I have no judgements about women who work outside the home vs. women who work in the home raising a family. I admire women who can stay home and raise their kids full-time. I even envy them sometimes. It is a wonderful luxury to have the choice. But let's stipulate that it is NOT a choice that most women have in America today. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why does this even matter? It matters purely because Mitt Romney put the issue of his wife's views squarely on the table. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Ruth Marcus noted in her column yesterday in the Washington Post, Romney, when asked last week about the gender gap, twice said he wished his wife could take the question. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"My wife has the occasion, as you know, to campaign on her own and also with me,\" Romney told newspaper editors, \"and she reports to me regularly that the issue women care about most is the economy.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So it begs the question, is Ann Romney Mitt's touchstone for women who are struggling economically or not? Nothing in Ann Romney's history as we have heard it -- hardworking mom she may have been -- leads me to believe that Mitt has chosen the right expert to get feedback on this problem he professes to be so concerned about. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I have nothing against Ann Romney. She seems like a nice lady who has raised nice boys, struggled with illness, and handles its long-term effects with grace and dignity. I admire her grit in talking about her illness publicly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What is more important to me and 57% of current women voters is her husband saying he supports women's economic issue because they are the only issues that matter to us and then he fails on even those. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Let's put aside for a moment his views on women's health issues -- such as his pledge to repeal funding for Planned Parenthood or repeal title X -- which provides important health services for poor women, and true anecdotes (such as when he was a Bishop in his church, he actually went to a congregant's hospital room and told a young single mother who had just given birth that she was shaming the church and should give her baby away). Let's put those issues of respect and health dignity away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Let's just focus on his economic record on behalf of women. When Romney ran Bain Capital, less than 10% of the senior workforce were women. And he said in his 1994 Senate race that it was because he had trouble finding qualified women to be executives. Is there a woman alive who believes that? I personally believe that women hate the way our health issues were made a political football by the Republicans in the last several months. But I am pragmatic enough to believe that the economic issues do matter greatly to women and men alike. But the only way that Mitt Romney will succeed in closing the wide gender gap between him and President Obama is if he stops pretending that it doesn't exist.

She also supported Colin Kaepernick's peaceful protest of the NFL by urging Maroon 5 to pull out of the Super Bowl Halftime Show as Rihanna reportedly did.

(AP) \u2014 Archaeologists have uncovered a stone tool at an ancient rock shelter in the high desert of eastern Oregon that could turn out to be older than any known site of human occupation in western North America. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The find was announced Thursday by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which controls the land on which the site was found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR University of Oregon archaeologist Patrick O'Grady, who supervises the dig, says the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter outside Riley has not been fully excavated. But the tool, a hand-held scraper chipped from a piece of orange agate not normally found in eastern Oregon, was found about 8 inches below a layer of volcanic ash from an eruption of Mount St. Helens that has been dated to 15,800 years ago. The depth was about 12 feet below the surface. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bureau of Land Management archaeologist Scott Thomas said that if the age of the site holds up to scrutiny, it would be the oldest west of the Rockies, and another predating the so-called Clovis culture, once generally believed to be the first people to migrate from Asia into North America. The earliest Clovis artifacts, known for distinctive and elegant stone points, are dated to about 13,000 years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR O'Grady called the find \"tantalizing,\" but he added that they want to continue digging this summer to see whether the volcanic ash covers the entire area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Donald K. Grayson, professor of archaeology at the University of Washington, said the scientific community would be skeptical. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"No one is going to believe this until it is shown there was no break in that ash layer, that the artifact could not have worked its way down from higher up, and until it is published in a convincing way,\" he said. \"Until then, extreme skepticism is all they are going to get.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two pre-Clovis sites are well documented and generally accepted by scientists, Grayson said. One is Paisley Cave, located about 60 miles southwest of the Rimrock site. The other is Monte Verde in Chile. Both are dated about 1,000 years before the oldest Clovis sites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the date of Rimrock holds up, it would put people at the site about 1,500 years earlier, at the end of the Pleistocene era, when mastodons, mammoths, camels, horses and bison roamed the area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The find has yet to be submitted to a scientific journal for publication, but it has been reported in newsletters and at conferences, Thomas said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thomas found the site several years ago, while taking a break from carrying supplies to a session of the University of Oregon Archaeological Field School nearby that O'Grady was overseeing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thomas said he noticed an outcropping of an ancient lava flow, with some very tall sage brush growing in front of it, indicating very deep sediment deposits. The soil was black in front of the rock, indicating someone regularly built cooking fires there for a long time. An ancient streambed ran by, which would have given people more reason to stay there. And on the surface, he found a stone point of the stemmed type, found at sites both older and younger than Clovis. Similar points have been found at Paisley Cave NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Volunteers looking around the surface found some 30 stemmed points, and the field school started excavations in 2011, O'Grady said. Uncovered above and below the volcanic ash layer were fragments of teeth believed to be from ancient camels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tests by Archaeological Investigations Northwest Inc. of Portland on blood residue on the agate scraper were consistent with the bovid family of animals, Thomas said. The most likely bovine animal living in Oregon at that time would have been an ancestor of the buffalo.\nPassage 2:\nPORTLAND, Ore. - NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Near the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter outside of Riley in southeast Oregon, archaeologists recently discovered evidence suggesting one of the oldest known human occupations in the western United States, officials said Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Archaeologists with the Bureau of Land Management and the University of Oregon Archaeological Field School have been excavating at the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter since 2011. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Their discoveries have included a number of stone projectile points and tooth enamel fragments likely belonging to a prehistoric camel (Camelops sp.) that became extinct approximately 13,000 years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But what has the archaeological community most excited is a small stone tool found below a layer of volcanic ash. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Near the bottom of a 12-foot deposit, archaeologists discovered a layer of ash that was identified as volcanic ash from a Mt. St. Helens eruption about 15,800 years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Beneath the layer of volcanic ash, archaeologists discovered a small orange agate tool believed to have been used for scraping animal hides, butchering, and possibly carving wood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A blood residue analysis of the tool revealed animal proteins consistent with bison, the most likely species being Bison antiquus, an extinct ancestor of the modern buffalo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe discovery of this tool below a layer of undisturbed ash that dates to 15,800 years old means that this tool is likely more than 15,800 years old, which would suggest the oldest human occupation west of the Rockies,\u201d said Scott Thomas, BLM Burns District archaeologist. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Presently, Oregon\u2019s Paisley Cave, also managed by the BLM, is considered home to the earliest known residents of North America based on human physical evidence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2008, a team of archaeologists, led by Dr. Dennis Jenkins with the University of Oregon's Museum of Natural and Cultural History, discovered coprolites - dried feces - containing human DNA dated over 14,000 years old. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr. Patrick O\u2019Grady, with the University of Oregon Archaeological Field School, has been directing the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter excavations since they began. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWhen we had the volcanic ash identified, we were stunned, because that would make this stone tool one of the oldest artifacts in North America. Given those circumstances and the laws of stratigraphy, this object should be older than the ash,\u201d said O\u2019Grady. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"While we need more evidence before we can make an irrefutable claim, we plan to expand our excavation this summer and hopefully provide further evidence of artifacts found consistently underneath that layer of volcanic ash. That\u2019s the next step,\u201d he added, NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The University of Oregon Archaeological Field School, in partnership with the BLM and volunteers from the Oregon Archaeological Society, will begin its fifth season this summer, offering students, researchers and volunteers invaluable field experience. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stan McDonald, BLM Oregon/Washington lead archaeologist, explained the potential this discovery has for the archaeological community. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cFor years, many in the archaeological field assumed that the first humans in the western hemisphere were the Clovis people \u2013 dating to around 13,000 years ago,\" McDonald said. \"While a handful of archaeological sites older than Clovis cultures have been discovered in the past few decades, there is still considerable scrutiny of any finding that appears older.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWith the recent findings at Rimrock Draw Shelter, we want to assemble indisputable evidence, because these claims will be scrutinized by researchers,\" he said. \"That said, the early discoveries are tantalizing.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Flickr photo album: https://www.flickr.com/photos/blmoregon/sets/72157651118216896/\n", "answers": ["A small stone tool unearthed in eastern Oregon appears to be so ancient that the history of humans in the area may have to be rewritten, archaeologists say.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Ministry of Health wants New Zealand to be smoke free by 2025 and the suggested increase gives the first hint of the drastic measures being discussed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A document released under the Official Information Act to the country's 3 News website features a number of pricing scenarios - with the most extreme showing a single cigarette costing the equivalent of \u00a32.50. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One option being considered is a 10% increase on a pack of 20 cigarettes year-on-year from 2013 to 2025, meaning it would cost $40 (\u00a320) a pack by 2024. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But a second scenario would see packs at $100 each by 2020, achieved by an immediate shock rise of 30% to 60%, with on-going increases of 30% each year after that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New Zealand aims to be smoke free by 2025 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This model would reach the 2025 target to stamp out smoking completely, but is described in the paper as \"probably unrealistic\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The most likely model would see a shock tax increase next year, and then a 10%-a-year rise, which would mean a packet of cigarettes costs around $60 (\u00a330) by 2025. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other ideas discussed in the document include regulating tobacco as a highly toxic substance, a ban on smoking in cars with children, a doubling of anti-smoking media campaigns and removing tobacco from duty-free sale. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The briefing paper said: \"If we are to continue to lower smoking prevalence we need to both increase the numbers who successfully quit smoking, and reduce smoking initiation among young people.

Then, when Yonotan stopped showing up for school, his mother told people he had gone to live in an institution in Mexico. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the court documents, Yonotan\u2019s three siblings and his mother were the only ones in on the secret.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe slopestyle course had some issues, and I just felt like my best bet was to focus on the halfpipe,\u201d White said Tuesday. \u201cThen the halfpipe had some issues.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The night before the competition, some athletes suggested that the event be postponed because of poor conditions and a lack of practice time. Crews worked overnight honing the shape of the pipe, which tilted downhill for about 250 yards. In the hour before the competition, workers sprinkled salt on its surface to get it to melt slightly and refreeze, and they sprayed it with water from large hoses. The result was not perfection but adequacy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A few, like Davis, took pratfalls in the gutter of the pipe. Others flew above its walls and crashed hard on the deck. Qualifications weeded the unlikely podium crashers out of the contest. A temperature close to freezing during the prime-time finals helped keep the pipe intact.

Unfortunately, this crucial forage fish appears to be in the midst of a severe population decline. Its absence will be felt by dozens of species of West Coast seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna that depend on sardines as a major food source. In addition, because sardines have been a staple of commercial purse-seine fishing on the West Coast, their decline raises the potential for fishing pressure to shift to similar, but more abundant, schooling species of forage fish. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, should do two things to help maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Set conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is so low. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fulfill its September 2013 commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish that are not currently managed or monitored. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cause for concern NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Populations of forage fish along the West Coast fluctuate widely, so a species can be abundant one year and dwindle unexpectedly the next. That\u2019s because forage fish are highly dependent on the upwelling of cold nutrient- rich waters to stimulate the growth of phytoplankton, their primary food source. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Pacific sardine fishery, immortalized in John Steinbeck\u2019s novel Cannery Row, collapsed notoriously the 1950s. The November 2013 population estimate of 378,000 tons is the lowest in more than a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000 and a major decline by historical standards. Geological records of fish scales deposited off Southern California indicate that the unfished sardine population fluctuated naturally between a low of 400,000 tons to as much as 16 million tons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Keeping an eye on the big picture NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Forage fish account for more than one-third of the global catch of marine fish and are mostly used for industrial purposes such as feed for livestock, poultry, and farmed fish rather than being directly eaten by people. Most forage fish landed on the West Coast are exported for purposes such as bait in tuna longlining in Asia or as feed for farmed fish. In 2012, the Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force, a group of eminent scientists from around the world, calculated that forage fish worldwide are worth twice as much when left in the water\u2014about $11.3 billion\u2014as they are when caught because of their value as food for commercially important predators.

After 12 hours and $1,000 worth of fuel, Corbin Hanson and his crew returned to port without a single fish. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Tonight's pretty reflective of how things have been going,\" Hanson said. \"Not very well.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To blame is the biggest sardine crash in generations, which has made schools of the small, silvery fish a rarity on the West Coast. The decline has prompted steep cuts in the amount fishermen are allowed to catch, and scientists say the effects are probably radiating throughout the ecosystem, starving brown pelicans, sea lions and other predators that rely on the oily, energy-rich fish for food. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If sardines don't recover soon, experts warn, the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds and fishermen could suffer for years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The reason for the drop is unclear. Sardine populations are famously volatile, but the decline is the steepest since the collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century. And their numbers are projected to keep sliding. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One factor is a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which in recent years has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast. While those conditions have brought a boom in some species, such as market squid, they have repelled sardines. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If nature is responsible for the decline, history shows the fish will bounce back when ocean conditions improve. But without a full understanding of the causes, the crash is raising alarm. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An assessment last fall found the population had dropped 72% since its last peak in 2006. Spawning has taken a dive too. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In November, federal fishery managers slashed harvest limits by more than two-thirds, but some environmental groups have argued the catch should be halted outright. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We shouldn't be harvesting sardines any time the population is this low,\" said Geoff Shester, California program director for the conservation group Oceana, which contends that continuing to fish for them could speed their decline and arrest any recovery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Pacific sardine is the ocean's quintessential boom-bust fish. It is short-lived and prolific, and its numbers are wildly unpredictable, surging up and down in decades-long cycles in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment. When conditions are poor, sardine populations plunge. When seas are favorable, they flourish in massive schools. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was one of those seemingly inexhaustible swells that propelled California's sardine fishery to a zenith in the 1940s. Aggressive pursuit of the species transformed Monterey into one of the world's top fishing ports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And then it collapsed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By mid-century sardines had practically vanished, and in the 1960s California established a moratorium on sardine fishing that lasted 18 years. The population rebounded in the 1980s and fishing resumed, but never at the level of its heyday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since the 1940s scientists have debated how much of the collapse was caused by ocean conditions and how much by overfishing. Now, researchers are posing the same question. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's a terribly difficult scientific problem,\" said Russ Vetter, director of the Fisheries Resources Division at NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Separate sardine populations off Japan, Peru and Chile fluctuate in the same 50- to 70-year climate cycle but have been more heavily exploited, Vetter said. West Coast sardines are considered one of the most cautiously fished stocks in the world, a practice that could explain why their latest rebound lasted as long as it did. The West Coast's last sardine decline began in 1999, but the population shot back up by the mid-2000s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In recent years scientists have gained a deeper understanding of sardines' value as \"forage fish,\" small but nutrition-packed species such as herring and market squid that form the core of the ocean food web, funneling energy upward by eating tiny plankton and being preyed on by big fish, seabirds, seals and whales. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, they say, there is evidence some ocean predators are starving without sardines. Scarcity of prey is the leading theory behind the 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up along beaches from Santa Barbara to San Diego in early 2013, said Sharon Melin, a wildlife biologist at the National Marine Fisheries Service. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Melin's research indicates that nursing sea lion mothers could not find fatty sardines, so they fed on less nutritious market squid, rockfish and hake and produced less milk for their young in 2012. The following year their pups showed up on the coast in overwhelming numbers, stranded and emaciated.\n", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment\u2014the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans\u2014which also depend on sardines for food\u2014are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)\u2014and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

The New York Times did not, however, feature this account in its coverage of Sharon's death. Instead, it re-ran online a 1983 apologia by Sharon for his invasion of Lebanon, during which there were nearly 50,000 casualties, most of them civilians. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Lebanon war that Sharon, then the defense minister, did more than anyone else to launch was an unmitigated catastrophe for the Palestinians, the Lebanese, and in the view of most Israelis at the time, Israel itself. Israel's subsequent occupation of South Lebanon until 2000, the consequent intensification of the Lebanese civil war, the slaughter of untold numbers of innocents, and the deaths of hundreds of Israeli soldiers and thousands of other combatants should all be laid in large part at Sharon's feet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sharon's profound impact on the Middle East stretched far beyond Lebanon. If the creation of a truly sovereign, independent, contiguous, and viable Palestinian state is not possible today -- as most sober observers believe -- this is largely his achievement. From his appointment as agriculture minister in 1977 until his passing from the Israeli political scene after his stroke in 2006, he probably did more than any other Israeli leader to make Israel's colonization of the occupied West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem an astonishing success. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sharon flew over the region in a helicopter to select sites for new colonies, all the while pioneering novel means of stealing land from its Palestinian owners. As prime minister, he continued this expansion process, which has turned the occupied West Bank into a Swiss cheese patchwork thoroughly dominated by lush Israeli settlements on what seems to be every hilltop. Simultaneously, he engineered a unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, while retaining draconian control over it from without, thereby turning it into the world's largest open-air prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vice President Joe Biden eulogized Sharon today as a \"historic leader\" who was dedicated to the pursuit of peace. The very idea is ludicrous. Sharon began his career as a military commander renowned for ruthless assaults on innocent civilians -- like the slaughter in the West Bank village of Qibya in 1953, when commandos of his Unit 101 blew up homes over the heads of their residents, killing 69 people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The attack led to the first ever U.N. Security Council condemnation of Israel. It was not an isolated incident: Indeed, it established a pattern of dozens of \"eyes for an eye,\" and of the Israeli leadership's systematic deception about what was actually happening on the ground. This approach has characterized Israel's response to any resistance to its expansion since the foundation of the state. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sharon was emblematic of the Israeli refusal to accept that Palestinian resistance was an inevitable response to the forcible establishment of a Jewish state and the concomitant expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. In later years, he became one of the most sophisticated employers of the trope of \"terrorism\" to demean this resistance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The characterization not only of those who took up arms against Israel, but of all Palestinians, as \"terrorists\" can be seen in the transcript of a meeting between Sharon, other Israeli ministers, and U.S. envoy Morris Draper on Sept. 17, 1982, in the midst of the Sabra and Shatila massacres. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Morris Draper: The hostile people will say, sure the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is going to stay in West Beirut and they will let the Lebanese go and kill the Palestinians in the camps. Ariel Sharon: So we'll kill them. They will not be left there. You are not going to save them. You are not going to save these groups of the international terrorism [sic]. MD: We are not interested in saving any of these people. AS: If you don't want the Lebanese to kill them, we will kill them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Everyone present at this meeting, American and Israelis, knew that there were no PLO fighters in the camps. More than 15,000 PLO personnel had been evacuated from Beirut weeks earlier in a deal brokered by the United States. Had any number of these hardened combatants -- who had resisted the Israeli siege of Beirut for nearly two months -- been present, the perpetrators of these massacres would not have been able to operate with total impunity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nonetheless, during this 90-minute meeting with Draper, Sharon repeated the canard that thousands of \"terrorists\" had remained behind after the PLO evacuation. He used the term \"terrorist\" 39 times, as part of a ceaseless browbeating of Draper, who had been told to demand that the Israelis immediately withdraw their forces from West Beirut. Instead of complying with Draper's request, Sharon stonewalled, giving the butchers inside the camps many more hours to complete their gruesome work under the glow of star shells fired by Israeli troops to illuminate the killing ground. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Today, the American and Israeli media are celebrating this very same man. It is hard to imagine this kind of kid-glove treatment of anyone else with such a list of atrocities to his name. But apparently, such inconvenient facts are not welcome. In a more just world, he would have ended up facing the International Criminal Court in The Hague. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yoav Lemmer-Pool/Getty Images\nPassage 2:\nCorrection: An earlier version of this op-ed incorrectly stated that Ariel Sharon \u201cwithdrew troops from southern Lebanon.\u201d Then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak withdrew Israeli troops from southern Lebanon in 2000. The following version has been updated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Henry A. Kissinger was secretary of state from 1973 to 1977. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arik Sharon started as a warrior. He ended his career on the way to being a peacemaker. On that journey from fighting in every one of Israel\u2019s wars to lying comatose for eight years in a Jerusalem hospital, he symbolized the anguish and dilemmas of Israel. A people who had come to their historic homeland had established themselves, surrounded by a culture that never acquiesced in ceding what it considered Islamic patrimony. Even before the proclamation of the Jewish state, Israel found itself in a state of war that has never ended. It has always lacked the essential prerequisite for peaceful coexistence with its neighbors: their recognition of its existence, which everywhere else is the precondition of diplomacy, not its outcome. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This state of affairs produced two aspects of the Israeli psyche: a hair-trigger response to security threats and an attitude toward the peace process both grudging and nostalgic. Israel\u2019s margin of survival has been so narrow that its leaders felt they could not run risks about emerging military capabilities of countries that refused to accept and daily castigated the Jewish state. When threatened, preemption became its style of warfare. And it viewed the peace process both with reluctance to give up territory in an environment so rife with denunciation and with a definition of peace so sweeping as to be very difficult to achieve in a single negotiation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When he was struck down by a stroke in 2006 , Sharon as prime minister was in the process of putting before his people a vision of coexistence with the Palestinians. Many visionaries of peace in Israel were military men: Yitzhak Rabin won the 1967 war. Shimon Peres, though not a military man, went the same route: a hawk in his early career, a passionate advocate of the peace process in recent decades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sharon had to undertake the longest journey to reach this insight. A daring commander, he conducted the battle that reversed the tide of the 1973 war; he was the principal advocate of the operations in Lebanon. For many years, he deplored America\u2019s decision in 1973 to bring about a negotiated end of the war. I was secretary of state at the time, and he missed few opportunities to chide me.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States acted as it did then because we were convinced that, however vast the margin of victory, it would leave Israel with its historic challenge: how to translate victories over threats to its security into political coexistence with the societies it lived among. The Egyptian leader, Anwar Sadat, seemed to offer such a prospect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In our many discussions, I always respected, then grew to admire and eventually develop affection for, this dedicated man living on a farm at the edge of the Negev desert, a kind of symbolic outpost. I looked forward to his visits while he was out of office; he would arrive at our meetings with maps under his arm that he used to explain the minimum requirements of Israel\u2019s survival. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As prime minister, Sharon unexpectedly broadened his definition of security. He sought to bridge the gap between physical and political security with the same courage and decisiveness that had brought him victory in battle. He volunteered the largest withdrawal in Israel\u2019s history. He ended the Israeli occupation of Gaza and returned it to Arab self-rule as a unilateral act without reciprocity, abandoning even the Jewish settlements that had been established there. These gestures were conceived as a test case for a negotiation about the future of the West Bank, which Sharon once had viewed as a permanent Israeli outpost. The man who had identified security with the acquisition of territory became willing to cede territory for an outcome to fulfill the hopes for peace. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It cannot be said that the result justified this act of faith. Israel was threatened by missile attacks from non-state actors: Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza. Politically, Sharon\u2019s vision was under attack from all sides: from those in Israel who insisted on a larger state, from Arab leaders who denied Israel the right to exist altogether, and from non-state terrorist groups. Still, Sharon\u2019s vision reflected an essential first step; it was a sacrifice on behalf of raising prospects for a lasting peace \u2014 to which both sides must make a contribution by taking concrete steps and not by largely symbolic acts alone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With another peace process underway, one needs to respect the courage of those who are willing to brave it in light of so many disappointments. It must be conducted both with commitment to the process and with a recollection of unfulfilled hopes. The vision of peace must be coupled with a determination not to permit the peace process to be turned into another form of warfare. An outcome must not only draw lines of territorial divisions but also bring a meaningful acceptance of the Jewish state by its negotiating partner as well as by key Arab states.

The findings of the study offer some potentially disappointing but illuminating conclusions that could inform advocacy and outreach strategies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abstract: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the US, the population of current vegetarians/vegans sits at approximately 2%, while approximately 10% of the population are former vegetarians/vegans and about 88% have never been veg. This study, published by HRC, looks closely at that 12% of the population that identifies as either current or former vegetarians/vegans, and tries to better understand what makes people lapse, and in turn, what factors might help keep people veg. The findings presented here offer a lot of possible avenues for new strategic thinking in veg advocacy, and how we might move the vegetarian/vegan diet from the margins more towards the center. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though there is rarely just one reason for people adopting or giving up a veg diet, it is not completely clear if lapses are due more to social pressures (eating a diet that seems unusual or outside the norm), or based on some other difficulty inherent to the diet itself. That being said, the findings do illuminate some things that many lapsed vegetarians/vegans have in common, such as transitioning to the diet too quickly, not being involved socially with other veg folks, and not being able to address certain food cravings. The study also shows that current vegetarians/vegans have a wide range of motivations that keep them veg, which may mean that more diverse messaging and outreach could have a positive impact. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This phase of release is part of a larger study of U.S. vegetarians and vegans. You can read more about the key findings, as well as the see the tables and methodologies, in the attached PDFs.\nPassage 2:\nIn 1995 I decided to stop eating meat. I could never really quite explain why, I think it was something to do with watching a documentary where they cooked a cat and partly because I had a really crap job working for Wolves Poly and felt my life was slipping away. It definitely wasn't anything to do with any 'vegetarian month'. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I did a number of weird things. I experimented with stopping washing my hair (it got greasy), I stopped watching TV after catching Newsnight really stoned and deciding that Jeremy Paxman was fundamentally a comedian so there was little difference between the news and Beadle's About. I also stopped eating meat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR First it was just red meat. I said goodbye in a Birmingham Burger King; the sandwich was greasy and unpleasant and I thought 'good riddance'. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I found eating only white meat was hard. People didn't know what to cook for me - they'd tell me I was just being awkward. They were right, so there was only one thing for it, cutting out all meat altogether. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So I simply stopped putting it in my mouth. It was that simple. I didn't feel any different and what I cooked didn't really change as I was a complete povvo and didn't bother buying much meat anyway. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To be honest, I was the world's worst vegetarian. You see - I didn't really like vegetables very much. I'd spent most of my childhood terrified of them - horrid bland mushy things. It's only as an adult I realise that part of the problem is my mother's cooking - she hates using salt and has a tendency to over boil things. Thanks, Mum. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So there we are. A vegetarian who hates vegetables and mostly lives on pasta and cheese. Healthy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fast-forward nearly 15 years and I'm a father of two and increasingly aware of my diet. My wife stopped her vegetarian ways when pregnancy brought cravings for meat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With her help (this makes her sound like my sponsor in Fussy Eaters Anonymous) I'd managed to eat more vegetables - by the time our second child was in the womb she was having spinach cravings and I didn't complain once about having to eat boiled green leaves every day. For six months. So I was doing better with a wider diet but still no drinking from the meaty cup. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR My four-year-old son has the restricted palate that children often have. He mostly refuses to eat anything that isn't sausages or fruit, so dining out was becoming difficult. There was the small circle of cheesy carbs I'd eat, and the intersection with the circle of sausages that my son wants to eat was - well, if you understand your Venn diagrams you'll know there wasn't much in the middle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was a trip to Hastings that finally did it. At a fish 'n' chip shop pretty much the only thing on the menu I could eat was a microwaved cheese pasty. I simply couldn't face it and ordered fish. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Can't say I particularly enjoyed it. I found the portion of thick white flesh alarmingly large and I didn't want to think about the skin at all. However it did leave me feeling satisfied in a way that I haven't felt in a long time. Every cell in my body screaming \"protein - that's what you need.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR My wife was very impressed with me. She asked me what I wanted to try next and the thing that had been filling my thoughts since deciding to allow meat back into my life was pepperoni pizza. Those little toasted cups of fat that make for a party in the mouth everyone can afford. Although to ponce it up a bit we ate it in Hampstead. Lardy dah. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bacon. Let's talk about bacon. There's no meat more glorious than bacon. You can add it to pasta instead of cheese. You can stick it in a sandwich, er ... instead of cheese. Or even rub it on to attract men (a top tip there ladies). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On telling my friends I was eating meat, one looked proud and said, \"Welcome back to Man Club.\" Although my new macho credentials were severely dented by the admission that largely I'd been eating chicken - \"Chicken? Why, us men class chicken as a vegetable.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I still haven't tried real meat. I can do a spag bog or even a burger but no steaks. I'm still a bit frightened of them. All too fleshy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many people must have had a similar experience. If you're a lapsed vegetarian (or a resurgent meat eater), what was it that made you fall off the vegetarian wagon?\nPassage 3:\nAfter decades of a growing appetite for meat, U.S. consumption is finally dropping after hitting \"peak meat\" a decade ago. But while many people are eating less meat, giving it up totally is much harder. Few people stick with their decision to become vegetarian or vegan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an attempt to move animal-free diets \"from the margins more towards the center,\" the Humane Research Council just put out the first study to put numbers to the lapsed vegetarian phenomenon. Their main takeaway is essentially what people have said for years: getting people to reduce their meat and dairy intake will be more effective overall than demanding \"purity,\" or complete elimination of animal products from their diet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to their research, drawn from a representative sample of more than 11,000 adults over age 17 in the U.S., while only 2% of the U.S. population is currently vegetarian or vegan, another 10% used to be. Put another way, they found that only 1 in 5 vegetarians and vegans maintains their diet; a full 84% eventually revert back to eating meat or other animal products. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study also shows how and why many people lapse. Most former vegetarians and vegans (65%) said they first transitioned to their veg diet in just a few days or weeks, while fewer current vegetarians (53%) transitioned that quickly, suggesting that perhaps a slower approach leads to longer-lasting results. They also found that the \"window of opportunity is limited,\" when it comes to getting people to stick to their diets: A third-of people abandoned their animal-free diets in three months or less, and more than half abandoned it within the first year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reasons for quitting varied, but perhaps intuitively, a lot comes down to relationships. A third of all former vegetarians lived with a non-vegetarians or non-vegan partner when they went back to eating meat. The study also found that current vegetarians were more likely to cite multiple reasons for being vegetarian\u2014such as animal welfare, environmentalism, and personal health\u2014while many former vegetarians (58%) cited health as the main motivator. In other words, from the advocacy group\u2019s perspective, health can be an effective \"foot in the door\" approach to increasing the number of vegetarians and vegans, but often not enough to keep people animal-free for the long-term. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Humane Research Council also says advocates need to change the culture around being vegetarian or vegan and acknowledge its challenges. More than 60% of former vegetarians/vegans disliked sticking out from the crowd because of their diet, and 58% did not see their diet as part of their identity. Nearly 50% said they found it too difficult to maintain a \"pure diet.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The latest findings once again show that a message focused on reduction instead of elimination of animal products may be more effective to create an overall decline in animal product consumption,\" the report says. \"Advocates would be well advised to soften their appeals to avoid suggesting the choice is all or nothing.\"\n", "answers": ["It seems becoming a vegetarian and staying a vegetarian are two very different things. A whopping 84% of vegetarians end up eating meat again, and most people shift back within a single year, according to a new study. Specifically, 53% of vegetarians are meat-eaters again within 12 months, while more than 30% go back to meat within three months, the Huffington Post reports. Of the 11,000 people studied, 2% were vegetarians, 10% former vegetarians, and 88% lifelong meat-eaters. A major reason for lapsing, it seems, was social: Those who returned to being omnivorous didn't have enough support among friends for their vegetarian lifestyles. Earlier research points to health issues from staying meat-free, the Smithsonian reports. Some 35% of respondents to a separate survey of lapsed vegetarians said their own poorer health drove them back to animal flesh, Skeptoid reports. \"I will take a dead cow over anemia anytime,\" says one respondent. And in the Guardian, a lapsed vegetarian writes about the inconvenience of avoiding meat, as well as the feeling of \"every cell in my body screaming 'protein\u2014that's what you need.'\" Perhaps the writer would agree with the conclusions of the new study, as Co.Exist reports them: \"A message focused on reduction instead of elimination of animal products may be more effective to create an overall decline in animal product consumption.\" (Read about a veggie burger that \"bleeds\" like meat.)"], "incorrect_answer": "Sorry, your context is too long to summarize."}, {"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nYouTube\u2019s top trending content at the moment isn\u2019t an advertisement, music video, or movie trailer.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Liza Koshy, 22, is best known for going to stores and causing improvisational mischief, often featuring random items that anyone can buy. David Dobrik, 21, has also made a name for himself through funny vlogs, many of which feature his relationship with Koshy. Combined, the two have over 21 million subscribers, making them one of the most visible power couples on the platform. Except that the two broke up six months ago, according to a video uploaded yesterday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The split may come as a surprise to some fans, given that the two have been uploading videos with each other this entire time. Just two weeks ago, Dobrik shared footage of him surprising Koshy with a puppy, and before that, there was another video in which he brings her a monkey. But according to the pair, the two had grown apart enough that staying in a relationship just didn\u2019t make sense anymore: they were leading separate lives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dLiza broke up with me because she felt like we\u2019ve been kinda distant, because we\u2019ve just been so busy, period,\u201d Dobrik said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The video\u2019s popularity is not entirely thanks to the viewers who normally follow the everyday minutia of their favorite YouTubers. It\u2019s gone viral because of how obvious it is that the two deeply care for one another. They joke around, they crack up, they cry. They sing each other\u2019s praises and talk about how they\u2019re still best friends. They make jabs about future boyfriends and girlfriends. When Koshy says that she is going through something and that she needs to love herself before she can love someone else, she knows it\u2019s clich\u00e9 \u2014 so you believe her. It helps that she pokes fun at herself. \u201cThis is gonna sound so lame, but I really want to spread love but I have to have it first, you know?,\u201d Koshy says, laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying you\u2019re gonna spread mayonnaise when you only have mustard.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Where before partners might consider joining their banking accounts, lovers in 2018 have to think about what it means to merge their brands NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At this point, breakups are their own genre of video on YouTube, and plenty of couples have announced a separation in front of the camera. Where before partners might consider joining things like banking accounts or bills, lovers in 2018 have to think about what it means to merge your brand with someone else\u2019s. You don\u2019t have to be a big YouTube star to think about when you make a relationship Instagram official, how much a partner should be mentioned on your social media feeds, or even what labels you publicly use for one another. To what degree should you own your relationship online? How will that relationship define you in the eyes of others on the internet? Even a simple tagged photo carries a much bigger meaning for some of us. You don\u2019t want to give people the wrong idea about where things stand with certain people \u2014 or maybe you do want to send a very specific message out there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While most of us can simply stop tagging an ex on our social media accounts, YouTubers with channels revolving around their lives don\u2019t have that luxury. Their entire livelihoods could be at risk if they disappoint or upset the audience following them. As ridiculous as it might sound, there\u2019s a real need for disclosure regarding where they stand with those regularly featured in their videos. If nothing else, airing everything out this publicly is a preventative measure that could minimize the chance that either person will get harassed by fans who believe one person ought to be blamed for the breakup. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Koshy and Dobrik know they\u2019re operating within this strange space. They waited a long time to tell YouTube fans because they were both angry that they grew apart in the first place. And while we all know that what influencers show us is just a well-edited sliver of a much bigger picture, there\u2019s a subtext of realness here. Koshy jokes that she could have wiped away her tears and fix up her appearance, but that wouldn\u2019t be authentic. You believe her. More than that: you can\u2019t help but watch and think, Man, I wish I had had a breakup as healthy as this one.\nPassage 2:\nThis was a very very stupid idea.

Together we account for about 40 percent of the world\u2019s emissions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We need to solve this problem together because neither one of us can solve it alone. Even if the United States somehow eliminated all of our domestic greenhouse gas emissions, it still wouldn\u2019t be enough to counteract the carbon pollution coming from China and the rest of the world. Likewise, even if China went down to zero emissions, it wouldn\u2019t make enough of a difference if the United States and the rest of the world didn\u2019t change direction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That\u2019s the reality of what we\u2019re up against. That\u2019s why it matters that the world\u2019s most consequential relationship has just produced something of great consequence in the fight against climate change. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Today, President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping are jointly announcing targets to reduce carbon emissions in the post-2020 period. By doing this \u2013 together, and well before the deadline established by the international community \u2013 we are encouraging other countries to put forward their own ambitious emissions reduction targets soon and to overcome traditional divisions so we can conclude a strong global climate agreement in 2015. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Our announcement can inject momentum into the global climate negotiations, which resume in less than three weeks in Lima, Peru, and culminate next year in Paris. The commitment of both presidents to take ambitious action in our own countries, and work closely to remove obstacles on the road to Paris, sends an important signal that we must get this agreement done, that we can get it done, and that we will get it done. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is also a milestone in the United States-China relationship, the outcome of a concerted effort that began last year in Beijing, when State Councilor Yang Jiechi and I started the United States-China Climate Change Working Group. It was an effort inspired not just by our shared concern about the impact of climate change, but by our belief that the world\u2019s largest economies, energy consumers and carbon emitters have a responsibility to lead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The targets themselves are also important. Ambitious action by our countries together is the foundation to build the low-carbon global economy needed to combat climate change. The United States intends to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 \u2013 a target that is both ambitious and feasible. It roughly doubles the pace of carbon reductions in the period from 2020 to 2025 as compared to the period from 2005 to 2020. It puts us on a path to transform our economy, with emissions reductions on the order of 80 percent by 2050. It is grounded in an extensive analysis of the potential to reduce emissions in all sectors of our economy, with significant added benefits for health, clean air, and energy security. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Our target builds on the ambitious goal President Obama set in 2009 to cut emissions in the range of 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. We are on track to meet that goal, while creating jobs and growing the economy, with the help of a burgeoning clean energy sector. Since the president took office, wind energy production has tripled and solar energy has increased by a factor of ten. This summer, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed the first carbon pollution standards for existing power plants, which account for a third of United States carbon pollution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Chinese targets also represent a major advance. For the first time China is announcing a peak year for its carbon emissions \u2013 around 2030 \u2013 along with a commitment to try to reach the peak earlier. That matters because over the past 15 years, China has accounted for roughly 60 percent of the growth in carbon dioxide emissions world-wide. We are confident that China can and will reach peak emissions before 2030, in light of President Xi\u2019s commitments to restructure the economy, dramatically reduce air pollution and stimulate an energy revolution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR China is also announcing today that it would expand the share of total energy consumption coming from zero-emission sources (renewable and nuclear energy) to around 20 percent by 2030, sending a powerful signal to investors and energy markets around the world and helping accelerate the global transition to clean-energy economies. To meet its goal, China will need to deploy an additional 800 to 1,000 gigawatts of nuclear, wind, solar and other renewable generation capacity by 2030 \u2013 an enormous amount, about the same as all the coal-fired power plants in China today, and nearly as much as the total electricity generation capacity of the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is no question that all of us will need to do more to push toward the de-carbonization of the global economy. But in climate diplomacy, as in life, you have to start at the beginning, and this breakthrough marks a fresh beginning. Two countries regarded for 20 years as the leaders of opposing camps in climate negotiations have come together to find common ground, determined to make lasting progress on an unprecedented global challenge. Let\u2019s ensure that this is the first step toward a world that is more prosperous and more secure.\nPassage 2:\nThe United States and China are pledging to move faster to reduce or limit emissions of heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming. China and the U.S. are the world's two largest polluters, and by taking action together, leaders from both countries hope to spur other nations to be equally aggressive as they work to finalize a worldwide climate treaty next year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What both countries are announcing, according to the White House: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR UNITED STATES NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014Reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent by the year 2025, compared to what the U.S. was emitting in 2005.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014Double the rate at which the U.S. is reducing its emissions per year. Between 2005 and 2020, the U.S. on average must cut emissions 1.2 percent per year to meet Obama's overall goal of 17 percent. Over the five years between 2020 and 2025, the U.S. aims to reduce emissions and average of 2.3 percent to 2.8 percent per year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014Submit the new 2025 emissions reduction target by the end of the first quarter of 2015 as the intended U.S. contribution to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty that nations hope to finalize later in 2015 in Paris. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CHINA NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014Set a target for carbon dioxide emissions to peak by around 2030, with the goal of topping out earlier if possible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014Expand the share of China's energy consumption derived from zero-emission sources to about 20 percent by 2030. The U.S. says that would require China to develop up to 1,000 gigawatts of new power from sources like nuclear, wind and solar.\n", "answers": ["The US and China rank as the world's two largest polluters, but a surprise deal is turning them into the world's two largest pollution fighters: The nations announced that they'll be working in tandem on long-term greenhouse-gas controls that would cut emissions by nearly a third over the next 15 years or so, CNN reports. \"As the world's two largest economies, energy consumers, and emitters of greenhouse gases, we have a special responsibility to lead the global effort against climate change,\" President Obama said in a joint press conference with Chinese President Xi Jinping today at the end of the APEC summit. The move, which was months in the making, came as a surprise to experts expecting a much more limited scope, the Wall Street Journal reports. Calling it a \"game changer,\" Mother Jones notes that it could heavily influence next year's climate talks in Paris. Key mandates include the US reducing emissions by 26% to 28% by the year 2025 (compared to the year 2005), as well as doubling the rate of emissions reduction each year between 2020 and 2025 to an average 2.3% to 2.8%, the AP reports. China is pledging to stop increasing emissions by 2030 (even earlier, if possible), as well as increase energy from zero-emission sources such as wind, solar, and nuclear to 20% by 2030.

While some voters will feel a bit of a sugar-high from the conventions, the basic structure of the race has not changed significantly. The reality of the Obama economy will reassert itself as the ultimate downfall of the Obama Presidency, and Mitt Romney will win this race. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his acceptance speech, President Obama did not offer any solutions for the millions of Americans unemployed or underemployed. But his convention speech was not the only big letdown to voters, as Americans also dealt with yet another dismal jobs report last week. President Obama is the only president in modern American history to stand before the American people asking for re-election with this many Americans struggling to find work. The key numbers in this election are the 43 straight months of 8% or higher unemployment, the 23 million Americans struggling to find work, and the 47 million Americans who are on food stamps. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Today, there is no question: Americans are not better off than we were four years ago, and that is why President Obama has struggled in this race. The truth is that some of President Obama\u2019s allies are claiming victory, but others are acknowledging the unsustainable position in which they find themselves. This is evidenced in a recent quote in The New York Times by an Obama Administration official saying, \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not what I would call the position we wanted to be in at this point in the race\u2026He\u2019s going to have to make the case that we wouldn\u2019t even be at 8 percent if it weren\u2019t for him.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Consider the following points: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Obama Economy: The stakes are very high in this election, and voters understand the future of our country is on the line. This may be lost on those living within the hyper-political world in and around the Beltway, but it is not lost in communities in battleground states. In short, the Romney-Ryan campaign understands Americans struggling in the Obama economy will determine the outcome of the race, and once the preponderance of information about the President\u2019s failed policies \u2013 combined with Mitt Romney\u2019s vision to strengthen the middle class \u2013 are communicated, our nation will move in a different direction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All Signs Point to a Tight Race: Those watching the daily tracking polls know that, while the President has seen a bounce from his convention, his approval has already begun to slip, indicating it is likely to recede further. In eight states, Pollster.com\u2019s reporting of the most recent statewide polls puts the margin between the two candidates at less than three points, virtually guaranteeing a tight race.

In both states, Pollster.com\u2019s reporting of the most recent statewide polls puts Obama\u2019s lead at only seven points in each of these states. In North Carolina, fresh off of hosting the Democratic National Convention, the Obama campaign is laying the groundwork for a stealth withdrawal. In a state the President won by a mere 14,000 votes in 2008, all one has to do is look at the Obama campaign\u2019s television buy in the state to understand how they view their chances there. The Obama campaign\u2019s North Carolina television buy has dropped 35% compared to June, and they have run more than twice as much advertising over the past two weeks in Rochester, Minnesota (hitting a small slice of Iowa), than they have in any North Carolina market. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Historical Data: Political campaign historians will recall President Jimmy Carter led Ronald Reagan by a near double digit margin late in the fall in 1980. In that race, the voters made their decision based on the key issues confronting the nation and it determined the outcome. On the economy, the most important issue of this race, Mitt Romney leads by 51%-45%, according to the most recent CNN/ORC poll. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Targeted Campaign: The Romney-Ryan campaign is running deeply local and targeted efforts in each of the states focusing on the voter groups that will make the difference on Election Day. Anyone asserting a \u201cone-size-fits-all-campaign\u201d effort is being put forward is simply misinformed, as evidenced by the 15 different ads released by the Romney Ryan campaign this past Friday and now running in nine states, including Wisconsin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New Money Advantage: All of this is not possible without resources, and the Romney-Ryan campaign and the Republican Party have a real advantage. In August alone, the Romney Victory effort raised more than $111 million, marking the third straight fundraising month of more than $100 million, putting us on a very strong financial footing for the final two months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Energy and Enthusiasm: CNN/ORC\u2019s most recent polling shows that 62% of Republicans are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d excited about this election, while only 56% of Democrats report being \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d excited. This Republican enthusiasm advantage has manifested itself in an unprecedented and historic grassroots effort that will have a significant impact on turnout in battleground states on Election Day. For instance, as of today, Victory volunteers have already knocked on more doors than during the entire 2008 campaign. (2.72 million in 2012 through September 8 compared to 2.43 million overall in 2008.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney\u2019s Ground Game: During last weekend\u2019s \u201cSuper Saturday,\u201d we crossed the 20 million volunteer voter contact threshold. Also, the Romney campaign knocked on more doors last week than in any week during the 2008 campaign. More than 55,000 volunteers have knocked doors or made phone calls for Victory this year and that number is growing by the week. And volunteers have collected person-to-person identification information on nearly 1.7 million swing voters in battleground states thus far. And the numbers are even more startling when one looks at individual states. For instance, in Ohio alone, five times more phone calls and 28 times more door knocks have been made than at this time in 2008. This past Saturday, more than 100,000 doors were knocked on by Victory volunteers in the Buckeye State. And in Wisconsin, five times more phone calls and 72 times more door knocks have been made than at this time in 2008. And the list goes on and on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mitt Romney will be the next President. The outcome of this race will ultimately be determined in favor of Governor Romney because he has the better leadership skills, the better record, and the better vision for where he wants to take the country. These advantages are being fueled by the commitment and determination of volunteers and voters to change direction and move our country on a path toward economic growth and job creation. In short, the combination of having the superior candidate, being in a margin-of-error race with an incumbent President, having a cash advantage, and having an unprecedented grassroots effort and a winning message on the economy ensure that Americans will make a change in leadership in Washington on November 6.\nPassage 2:\nAP NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Mitt Romney campaign circulated a statement Monday from its pollster, Neil Newhouse, conceding that President Barack Obama \"has seen a bounce from his convention\" in daily tracking polls but urging readers not to \"get too worked up about the latest polling.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Newhouse characterized the recent shift to Obama as \"a bit of a sugar-high from the conventions\" and argued that the \"basic structure of the race has not changed significantly\": NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All Signs Point to a Tight Race: Those watching the daily tracking polls know that, while the President has seen a bounce from his convention, his approval has already begun to slip, indicating it is likely to recede further.

PPP has these polls that just put chum in the water for the media. Sometimes I think there's a conscious effort between the media and Chicago to get Republicans depressed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A poll tracking model created for HuffPost Pollster by political scientist Simon Jackman, based on all polling at the national and state levels, shows that the conventions have helped boost Obama's share of the vote to his highest levels since early March. The model currently has Obama leading Romney by 3 percentage points.\nPassage 3:\nI asked a top Romney adviser what he makes of reports that the Romney campaign knows it\u2019s losing and that Ohio is slipping out of reach (PPP has a new poll with Obama at 50 in the state): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It\u2019s horses**t.

And I hope our friends realize that all these media analysts out there are Democrats WHO WANT US TO LOSE. And the more Washington DC controls our economy, the more important inside-the-beltway publications are and the more money they make. The 202 area code is dominated by people who will make more money if Obama is reelected, so it\u2019s not just an ideological thumb they\u2019re putting on the scale for him, it\u2019s a business interest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I actually think the other side is in a panic. You look at New Mexico closing up. And they\u2019re not above 50 in any of their target states.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Any time you're going to do an R-rated comedy, you're going to offend someone,\" said Ferrell in an interview alongside Hart. He continued: \"But that's kind of what we do. We provoke. We prod. We also show a mirror to what's already existing out there. We're playing fictitious characters who are articulating some of the attitudes and misconceptions that already exist.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Get Hard\" was written by Cohen along with Jay Martel and Ian Roberts, writing-producers from the sketch comedy show \"Key and Peele.\" This is Cohen's directorial debut after penning screenplays to films like \"Idiocracy\" and \"Tropic Thunder,\" a film that memorably flirted with racially sensitive territory in Robert Downey Jr.'s lampoon, in black face, of a Method actor run amok. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In many ways, the comedy of \"Get Hard\" works similarly. Just as the humor of Downey's actor wasn't in his favor but about his own self-obsessive, racist delusions, Ferrell's character is a parody of the narrow perspective of the elitist one percent. He hires Hart's carwash owner and family man under the mistaken presumption that he's been to prison, that he's \"hard.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You're looking at two characters that judged each other by their cover,\" said Hart. \"And after peeling off some of the layers to their onion, they realize that, 'Oh my God, this isn't the person I thought it was from the jump. It's a completely different person.' And that road to friendship ensues.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Get Hard\" was conceived as a way to pair Hart and Ferrell, two of the most popular and bankable stars in comedy. Whether the film succeeds on its own terms or not, it's an attempt (one generally uncommon in wide-release studio films) to comment on contemporary issues of inequality and race within the context of a broad, often crude comedy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Adam McKay, Ferrell's longtime collaborator and a producer of \"Get Hard,\" said any backlash has been overinflated by \"lazy journalism.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Given that we're a country with runaway income inequality, more people in jail than any other country, this is what people are crowing about? Trying to in a funny way deal with these issues?\" said McKay in a phone interview with fellow producer Chris Henchy. \"It really kind of got me mad. It's just cheap is what it is.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McKay said the film was fashioned as \"a silly, filthy comedy\" on the outside, but a satire of income inequality underneath. Seeing the film as racist, he says, is \"kind of ridiculous and disheartening,\" since its intention is to parody those who live in bubbles of wealth and prejudice. To claims of homophobia he protested: \"Any individual going to maximum security prison would be afraid of violence and sexual assault. To equate that with homosexuality is ridiculous.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Others have agreed, albeit more skeptically. In reviewing the movie for Vanity Fair, Eric D. Snider wrote that the film wasn't offensive to him as a homosexual; it's just not funny enough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's not mean-spirited, and it's panicky straight guys, not gays, who are the target,\" wrote Snider. \"It's just disappointing, that's all.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Any bad buzz for \"Get Hard\" has likely been partially alleviated by the goodwill both Ferrell and Hart have in storage, as well as the distraction of Ferrell's dependably entertaining late-night appearances. The NAACP and GLAAD have not commented on the film. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Here's the beautiful thing about Will and myself: You're looking at two guys that are no strangers to criticism,\" said Hart. \"The critic's job is to critique. I don't think I've ever had a great review on a film that I've done. Not one. Everybody always has had something to say. And if they're not talking, then you have a problem.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whether the talking around \"Get Hard\" will affect it at the box office remains to be seen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"People will go see it and there probably will be some people who are offended. It's definitely a very dirty movie and it's harsh,\" says McKay. \"It's a good-hearted movie at its root. Everything comes out in the wash with movies because they hang around for, like 78 years. You always end up seeing what a movie really is in the long run.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lennox reported from Los Angeles.\nPassage 2:\nStarting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

With accusations that Get Hard is homophobic and racist, Ferrell defends the flick to the AP, noting he and costar Kevin Hart \"show a mirror to what's already existing out there.\" Do critics agree? \"Perhaps there's an edgy dark comedy to be made about race, class, and the prospect of facing prison, but Get Hard is not it,\" Claudia Puig writes at USA Today. The film's \"jokes are a cavalcade of racist and homophobic humorlessness.\" And though its cracks at class divisions perform better, they aren't worth the price of a movie ticket. Her advice: \"Unless you're really hard up for entertainment, stay away from this tone-deaf raunchfest.\" It \"seeks to make you laugh while also risking offense by going too far. It succeeds on both counts,\" writes Peter Howell more favorably at the Toronto Star. The film will undoubtedly offend a portion of the audience, but \"I enjoyed it because, unlike similar films of its ilk, everybody is in on the joke,\" he writes: white, black; rich, poor; etc. \"It's not great cinema, but it's also not just a scattershot of dumbness and vulgarity.\" And \"Ferrell and Hart make a good team.\" Cary Darling at DFW is less kind. \"Since anyone who has seen the trailer has already seen many of the film's best moments, making it through to the end does feel like something of a life sentence,\" she writes. Excepting a scene in which Hart portrays a black guy, a Latino guy, and a gay black guy within a matter of minutes, the film just doesn't bring the laughs. Instead, it's \"weighed down by middle-school jokes.\" At its best, Get Hard \"does a smartly scathing job\" of attacking privilege and entitlement, writes Ann Hornaday at the Washington Post. At its worst, it \"veers perilously close to committing the very sins it aspires to criticize.\" Particularly, \"the movie is drenched in gay panic\" and includes \"tiresome 'don't drop the soap' jokes,\" based on Ferrell's character's fears about being raped in prison.

The researchers estimated that 353 of the 506 antibiotic prescriptions written annually per 1000 population were appropriate.Broken down further, the data revealed that sinusitis diagnoses resulted in the most antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 population (56), followed by ear infections (47), and pharyngitis (43).\u201cHalf of antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory conditions may have been unnecessary, representing 34 million antibiotic prescriptions annually,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cCollectively across all conditions, an estimated 30% of outpatient oral antibiotic prescriptions may have been inappropriate.\u201dLast fall, the President signed an Executive Order on \u201cdetecting, preventing, and controlling antibiotic-resistant microbes\u201d as part of the White House\u2019s 5-year National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, which aims to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by 50% by 2020. Based on the current study results, a 15% reduction in overall antibiotic use would be necessary in order to meet that goal, the researchers noted.Because antibiotic overprescribing contributes to drug resistance, curbing the practice is a major public health care priority. Failure to do so could have grim consequences, as the CDC already estimates that 2 million individuals are infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria each year in the United States, and 23,000 of them die from these infections annually.In one of the more notorious examples , UCLA Health indicated that 179 patients might have been infected with \u201c superbug \u201d carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center during \u201ccomplex endoscopic procedures that took place between October 2014 and January 2015.\u201d\u201cHealth professionals generally know when antibiotics are and are not needed,\u201d lead study author Katherine Fleming-Dutra, MD, a medical epidemiologist with the CDC\u2019s Office of Antibiotic Stewardship, explained to Pharmacy Times. \u201cOften, clinicians are worried about patient satisfaction. They think that a patient wants antibiotics\u2026sometimes leading them to prescribe when they shouldn\u2019t.\u201dPharmacists can help prevent this by providing patients with information about the potential consequences of unnecessary antibiotic use.\u201cPharmacists are the last health professional to see a patient when an antibiotic is prescribed,\u201d Dr. Fleming-Dutra said. \u201cWhen dispensing antibiotics, pharmacists can educate patients about properly taking antibiotics and about potential harms from antibiotics such as allergies, adverse events, and antibiotic resistance.\u201dBeyond treating infections, other studies have found that as many as 1 in 10 health care providers prescribe antibiotics for almost every patient they see with a cold or bronchitis, despite the fact that antibiotics aren\u2019t effective against viral infections.\u201cIt is important for all health professionals in all regions seeing patients of all ages to only prescribe antibiotics when they are needed, and if needed, select the right antibiotic at the right dose for the right duration,\u201d Dr. Fleming-Dutra advised.The current study results appeared in the May 3, 2016, edition of JAMA.\nPassage 3:\nWASHINGTON\u2014The Pew Charitable Trusts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released today a first-of-its kind analysis of antibiotic use in doctors\u2019 offices, emergency rooms, and hospital-based clinics in the United States. The analysis, conducted in partnership with a panel of leading antibiotic use experts, identifies acute respiratory conditions as key drivers of antibiotic overuse in human health care and establishes data-driven targets for eliminating the approximately 47 million unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions issued in outpatient facilities across the country every year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The findings are outlined in two documents released today: Pew\u2019s report \u201cAntibiotic Use in Outpatient Settings\u201d and \u201cPrevalence of Inappropriate Antibiotic Prescriptions Among U.S. Ambulatory Care Visits, 2010-2011,\u201d an article authored by experts from Pew, CDC, and members of the panel, appearing in the current issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. They outline the baseline analysis and condition-specific targets, as well as practical strategies to improve prescribing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThis report provides the most in-depth picture to date of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in the U.S. and will serve as a benchmark in measuring progress moving forward,\u201d said David Hyun, M.D., a senior officer with Pew\u2019s antibiotic resistance project, who focuses on research and policy development pertaining to the stewardship of antibiotics in health care settings. \u201cWhile our estimates of unnecessary antibiotic use are conservative, it is clear that a small number of health conditions constitute the lion\u2019s share of unwarranted antibiotic prescriptions in this country. These detailed data will help health care providers target stewardship efforts where they can do the most good.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least 30 percent of antibiotics prescribed in outpatient settings in the United States are unnecessary, according to the report. The majority are prescribed for acute respiratory conditions such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu, and other viral illnesses that do not respond to antibiotics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe more antibiotics are used, the less effective they become. Reducing the needless use of antibiotics will slow the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microbes, so-called superbugs, which are among the most urgent public health threats of our time,\u201d said Kathy Talkington, director of Pew\u2019s antibiotic resistance project. \u201cPatients and health care providers must work together to understand when antibiotics will help and when they won\u2019t, and help preserve these lifesaving drugs for patients who really need them.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Antibiotic use in outpatient settings represents the majority of dollars spent on antibiotics for human health care in the United States, and outpatient providers are often the first place patients go for health care when suffering from a cold, flu, sore throat, or other common condition for which antibiotics are often unnecessarily prescribed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The analysis concludes that: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Approximately 13 percent of all outpatient office visits in the United States, or about 154 million visits annually, result in an antibiotic prescription; about 30 percent of these prescriptions are unnecessary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Forty-four percent of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions are written to treat patients with acute respiratory conditions, such as sinus infections, middle ear infections, pharyngitis, viral upper respiratory infections (i.e., the common cold), bronchitis, bronchiolitis, asthma, allergies, influenza, and pneumonia. Half of these prescriptions are unnecessary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2015, the White House released a national action plan for combating antibiotic resistance, which included the goal of reducing inappropriate outpatient antibiotic use by 50 percent by 2020. Based on the panel\u2019s estimate of unnecessary prescribing, this goal would be reached by reducing outpatient antibiotic use by 15 percent overall, which would result in approximately 23 million fewer antibiotics prescribed annually by 2020. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The panel outlined actions that health care providers, patients, and the health care industry as a whole can take to reach the targets, including: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Individual outpatient health care providers can evaluate their own prescribing habits as well as implement stewardship activities in their practices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Health systems can provide expertise and resources to offices within their network to aid in stewardship implementation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Health plans can assist in data collection and analysis\u2014evaluating the antibiotic prescribing habits of their providers and providing feedback that highlights potential areas for improvement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State and local health agencies can help provide outpatient facilities with information on best practices for implementing antibiotic stewardship programs, and help develop regional partnerships between various health care stakeholders, such as providers, health plans, and health systems, in order to better coordinate stewardship activities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Federal agencies can track antibiotic prescribing at the national level, identifying areas for further improvement and providing technical assistance to stakeholders interested in implementing stewardship efforts of their own. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Organizations such as the National Committee for Quality Assurance that develop standards to assess the quality of health care services can establish metrics to assess the antibiotic prescribing habits of health care providers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Health care professional societies can provide expert guidance to their members on appropriate antibiotic prescribing and incorporating diagnostics to aid in prescribing decision-making. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cPrescribing unnecessary antibiotics is just one element of inappropriate use of antibiotics,\u201d said Lauri Hicks, D.O., director of the CDC\u2019s Office of Antibiotic Stewardship in the Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. \u201cHealth care providers can also prescribe antibiotics at the wrong dose or for the wrong duration, amplifying the extent of inappropriate use. Setting a national target to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use is the first step, and we must work together across the health care continuum to reach this goal.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pew, CDC, and the expert panel are preparing a similar report on inpatient antibiotic prescribing.

CDC is working towards releasing an updated AR Threats Report in fall 2019.\nPassage 5:\nNEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR iStock NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This post has been updated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nearly a third of antibiotics prescribed in doctors' offices, emergency rooms and hospital-based clinics in the United States are not needed, according to the most in-depth study yet to examine the use and misuse of these life-saving drugs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The finding, which has implications for antibiotics' diminished efficacy, translates to about 47 million unnecessary prescriptions given out each year across the country to children and adults. Most of these are for conditions that don't respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu and other viral illnesses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although health officials have been warning for decades about the overuse of antibiotics and its contribution to the development of drug-resistant bacteria, the research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Pew Charitable Trust is the first to quantify the depth of the problem. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've all been hearing, 'This is a problem, this is problem,' and we all understood the general concept that there is a lot of antibiotic use,\" said David Hyun, a senior officer with Pew's antibiotic resistance project and one of the authors of the report published Tuesday in JAMA. Pew also published a companion report using the same data. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Why this study is so important: It actually provides concrete numbers,\" Hyun said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [CDC warns that Americans may be overmedicating young children with ADHD] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study analyzed data for all antibiotic use in the three settings as collected from two major CDC surveys from 2010 to 2011.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2022 More than four in 10 (44 percent) of antibiotic prescriptions are written to treat patients with acute respiratory conditions, such as sinus infections, middle ear infections, sore throats, colds, bronchitis, asthma, allergies, flu, and pneumonia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2022 Half of these prescriptions are unnecessary because many are for viral illnesses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Doctors often wind up prescribing antibiotics because of pressure from patients or parents, said Katherine Fleming-Dutra, a CDC medical epidemiologist and report's lead author. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Clinicians are concerned about patient satisfaction and the patient demand for antibiotics,\" she said. But the majority of individuals do trust their doctors to make the right diagnosis, and better communication by doctors about the dangers of antibiotic overuse can lead to more appropriate prescribing, she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An accompanying editorial in JAMA noted that the numbers provided in the report likely are an undercount because they don't include the times antibiotics are given when patients talk to doctors' offices over the telephone, or when patients seek medical care at urgent care clinics, retail pharmacies and dentists' offices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also not included are prescriptions written by nurse practitioners and physician assistants. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But even relatively simple steps, such as displaying a poster in patient waiting rooms can cut down on antibiotic prescribing, the editorial said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The overuse of antibiotics has led to the frightening rise of drug-resistant superbugs in recent years. The CDC has warned that \"nightmare bacteria\" are increasingly resistant to even the strongest antibiotics, posing a growing threat to hospitals and nursing homes nationwide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last year, the White House announced an aggressive plan to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which already cause an estimated 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths every year just in the United States.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts\u2014the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post\u2014isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections\u2014meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "incorrect_answer": "Sorry, your context is too long to summarize."}, {"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nThis is a collection of press articles about the End of Term 2016 project.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bombshell announcement that sent shock and surprise ricocheting through Washington ends the career of the man who was once seen as the unimpeachable and nonpartisan ideal of how a law enforcement officer should behave. But Comey saw his reputation tarnished when he was dragged into the toxic politics of the 2016 campaign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Trump administration attributed Comey's dismissal to his handling of the investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's email server, but Democrats ridiculed that notion, raising parallels to Watergate-era firings and suggested Comey was getting too close to the White House with the Russia probe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In any case, senior White House officials appeared to have badly misjudged the impact of Trump's sudden move. A source with knowledge of discussions inside the White House told CNN's Dana Bash that the thinking was that because Democrats were saying precisely what Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a letter explaining the grounds for Comey's dismissal, there would be no backlash. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What was not thought through, apparently, was an explanation of why Comey was fired now, at a time when critics would immediately conclude it was because of the Russia probe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In recent days, Comey again came under fire for his handling of the investigation into Clinton's private email server. Many Democrats believe that his announcement that he was reopening the probe 11 days before the election cost the former secretary of state the presidency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump referred to Democrats' criticism of Comey Wednesday morning, tweeting, \"The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad! \u2014 Donald J.

The source said he made a joke about it to lighten the mood and called his office to get confirmation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Longtime Trump ally Roger Stone was among those who recommended to the President that he fire Comey, according to a source familiar with the conversation. Stone, who also is being scrutinized by the FBI as part of its Russia investigation, spoke to Trump after Comey appeared at a hearing last week on Capitol Hill, according to the source. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump immediately disputed that Stone was involved: \"The Roger Stone report on @CNN is false - Fake News.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But multiple White House officials said Trump had been considering firing Comey for at least a week before he made Tuesday's decision. Indeed, Trump revealed his anger in a string of late-night messages on Twitter May 2, exactly a week before his final decision was made public. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the center of Rosenstein's rationale for recommending Comey's firing was the director's handling of the investigation into Clinton's private server, namely his decision to recommend no charges be filed and the news conference he held to explain his reasoning.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is not normal. This is not politics as usual,\" said Toobin, though he added that Trump did have the legal authority to fire an FBI director. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The White House, however, said that the impetus for the firing of Comey came from Rosenstein, noting that he was a career prosecutor who served under President Barack Obama as the US Attorney for Maryland, and was confirmed in his new job on April 25. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A senior administration official said that Rosenstein assessed the situation upon taking office and concluded the FBI director had lost his confidence.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I was as frustrated, concerned and disappointed as anyone with Director Comey's handling of the email investigation, but President Trump just fired the man investigating how Russia meddled in our election and whether members of his campaign were involved, an investigation President Trump called a \"charade\" only 24 hours ago,\" said Clinton's former campaign manager, Robby Mook.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I firmly believe the Russia angle is fake news. But this gives me pause,\" the person said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Senior Justice Department and FBI officials said they were unaware of the Comey decision until the announcement. Officials who spoke to CNN said they were shocked by the development. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comey's term was due to run until 2023. The decade-long tenure was introduced to shield FBI directors from being drawn into politics, but the position is still subject to dismissal at the pleasure of the President. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comey's last appearance on Capitol Hill last week exacerbated doubts about his position. Just before news of his dismissal broke, his office issued a statement aiming to clear up his testimony that former Clinton aide Huma Abedin \"forwarded hundreds and thousands\" of emails to her husband's laptop. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The note, signed by Gregory Brower, assistant director of the FBI's Office of Congressional Affairs, clarified that the \"hundreds and thousands of emails\" that Comey said were 'forwarded\" from Abedin to her husband's email \"included emails transferred via backups as well as manual forwarding.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The White House said it would immediately launch the search for a new FBI director. Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is now the acting FBI director, according to a message sent to employees by Sessions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comey was appointed FBI director by President Barack Obama in 2013. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In so doing, he elevated a Republican law enforcement veteran who had been critical of the Justice Department under former President George W. Bush to the top domestic investigative and surveillance organization, among the most powerful posts in the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the decades since former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the controversial director who brought the FBI into the modern era, law enforcement has avoided the appearance of influencing politics the way Hoover did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Comey's decision to thrust himself repeatedly into the 2016 election put him at odds with the FBI's general decision to stay away from the political spotlight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comey made the decision in July to go public with his recommendation that the Justice Department not pursue any charges against Clinton or her former staffers over her email practices as secretary of state. However, he also took the opportunity to rebuke Clinton at length as being \"extremely careless\" with sensitive information. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then-candidate Trump had talked up the investigation until this point, at which time he and his campaign derided Comey for the \"political\" decision. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just days away from the election, Comey jumped into the race again. He informed Congress, via letter, that the FBI had reopened its investigation into Clinton. The decision was made because of its investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, who is married to Clinton confidant Huma Abedin. Comey followed up days later with another letter, informing Congress that the FBI didn't find anything and continued to believe Clinton's practices did not merit the pursuance of any criminal charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After Clinton's loss, former President Bill Clinton blamed Comey for it, as have many Clinton staffers, at least in part. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last week, Hillary Clinton herself told CNN's Christiane Amanpour: \"I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After taking office, Trump met with Comey at the White House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He offered a cryptic remark to the FBI chief. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Oh, here's Jim,\" Trump said in January. \"He's become more famous than me.\"\nPassage 3:\nCalls to appoint an independent prosecutor have simmered for months, but until now, they had been voiced almost entirely by Democrats.

Payroll taxes increase for many employers across USA NORFOLK, Va. \u0097 Last year was the worst Don Miller had seen in more than 20 years of running a graphic printing business here. Business slumped 15%, and he had to lay off two of the three workers who helped him print stickers and signs for Navy ships. Miller hopes to bring them back, but hiring will be more expensive for all Virginia business owners this year. The recession has emptied Virginia's unemployment insurance trust fund, and the state is making up for it by raising taxes on employers and cutting jobless benefits for seniors. In 2009, the average business owner paid $95 per employee. This year, the tax will be $171, according to estimates by the state workforce agency. \"It's another added expense to hiring somebody,\" Miller says. \"Everything's going up, and business is going down.\" Similar tax increases are hitting employers nationwide this year as states struggle to pay the 5.5 million Americans currently collecting state jobless benefits. So far, high unemployment and, in many cases, poor planning have prompted 25 states to borrow more than $25 billion from the federal government to keep benefit checks in the mail. In other states, unemployment compensation funds are still in the black, but reserves are rapidly dwindling. Nine more states likely will be borrowing by mid-year, according to a ProPublica analysis of state revenue and benefits. Tax on businesses Business owners in 36 states face tax increases ranging from a few dollars to nearly $1,000 per worker. Six states are scaling back or freezing benefits for the unemployed: \u2022 Jobless Pennsylvania workers will get 2.3% less in benefits starting this month, while the average tax this year for businesses will increase to $432 from $384 per worker. \u2022 Hawaii's employers face an average increase to $1,070 from $90 per worker. The state also proposes decreasing the maximum benefit by as much as a third \u2014 about $190 per week. \u2022 Texas, where the trust fund is $1.4 billion in the red, has increased the average tax on employers to about $165 from $89 per worker. Instead of fulfilling the unemployment insurance system's purpose of stimulating the economy, these measures may contribute to joblessness, says Gary Burtless, an economist who studies labor policy at the Brookings Institution, a think tank. \"We don't want to pick this moment of all moments to boost taxes on employers,\" Burtless says. \"We want to encourage employers as much as possible to add to their payrolls.\" Workers are being hurt in another way \u2014 through benefit cuts. In Roanoke, Va., James Hay, 70, received a letter from the state informing him that his monthly unemploymentbenefits are being cut to $100 from about $800 because state law limits payments to Social Security recipients when the state's fund runs low. \"I was devastated when I read it,\" Hay says. \"I thought, 'Lord, what am I going to buy heating oil with this winter?' \" Like many other seniors, Hay was working full time to supplement his $1,400 monthly Social Security check, which he says was not enough to support him, his granddaughter and her two young children. Then the asphalt factory laid him off. Unemployment insurance made up for some of the lost income, but now Hay is not sure how his family will get by. \"We'll just have to do whatever we can do,\" he says. \"I hope and pray we'll be all right.\" States borrow heavily The state hopes to save about $11 million through the cuts to seniors but anticipates borrowing $1.3 billion to replenish its unemployment fund before the recession ends. \"The middle of a recession is when people need help most,\" says Maurice Emsellem, policy co-director of the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for low-wage workers. Cutting unemployment benefits, he says, \"undermines the fundamental goals of the program \u2014 boosting the economy and keeping people out of poverty in an economic downturn.\" Many states such as Virginia are already at or near the highest payroll tax rates allowed by law, and others have pushed politically difficult tax increases through their legislatures, making further benefit cuts likely if high unemployment persists, says Rich Hobbie, executive director of the National Association of State Workforce Agencies. Some of the pain might have been avoidable. Long before the recession began, Virginia and many other states that have imposed tax increases or benefit cuts let their trust funds dwindle well below the 18 months of reserves the U.S. Labor Department recommends. Virginia had to slow down federal borrowing despite the impact on businesses and seniors, says Republican state Sen. John Watkins, chairman of the Virginia Commission for the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund. \"I have angst for people who are unemployed,\" he says. \"But our trust fund is busted \u2014 it's gone.\" Pierce reports for ProPublica, an independent, non-profit newsroom based in New York.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Federal authorities arrested Joyce, 55, at his Westport home on Friday. Joyce pleaded not guilty to the charges before a federal magistrate in Worcester Friday afternoon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 113-count indictment against Joyce, stemming from a two-year investigation, includes charges of racketeering, extortion, wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the IRS and money laundering. His lawyer, Howard Cooper, said in an email to The Associated Press that he is still reviewing the charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR READ: THE FULL INDICTMENT AGAINST BRIAN JOYCE NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The indictment alleges that Joyce secretly profited from his position as state senator by accepting \u201ca stream of concealed bribes and kickbacks\u201d that included a free Jeep and hundreds of pounds of Dunkin Donuts coffee, in exchange for official actions before the state Legislature. He is accused of pressuring state and municipal officials to take official action on government matters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Acting U.S. Attorney William Weinreb said Joyce, who as a state senator represented more than 100,000 constituents across Milton, Randolph, Avon, Canton, Stoughton, West Bridgewater and parts of Braintree, East Bridgewater and Sharon, ran his public office as a \u201ccriminal enterprise.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cHe had a duty to serve (his constituents) honestly, and he violated that duty by accepting bribes and kickbacks in exchange for his official action,\u201d Weinreb said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In February 2016, the FBI and IRS raided Joyce\u2019s Canton law office. Months later, Joyce reportedly sold his Milton home and also sold his family burial plot in Milton, where he grew up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce is accused of participating in a number of complex schemes dating back to 2010 that netted him hundreds of thousands of dollars and concealing the payments by using his law office as a \u201cmoney laundering conduit.\u201d Prosecutors say he also lied to the state\u2019s ethics commission and used the panel as a \u201ccloak of legitimacy for his corrupt schemes.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In one case, prosecutors alleged Joyce used his position to exert influence on behalf of a New York-based energy brokerage business and formed a shell company to collect secret kickbacks from the firm. In another scheme, prosecutors say Joyce pressured the Milton Planning Board to approve a waiver sought by a developer, who gave Joyce a Jeep from one of the developer\u2019s car dealerships. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The indictment also accuses Joyce of taking legislative action to aid a Dunkin Donuts franchise whose owner was paying him tens of thousands of dollars for \u201cpurported legal fees\u201d and providing him with hundreds of pounds of free coffee. Investigators allege Joyce took steps to conceal this by submitting backdated checks to the State Ethics Commission and instructed the franchise owner and his relative to falsely represent to the Ethics Commission that they had agreed to provide Joyce coffee in exchange for legal services. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The indictment also alleges that Joyce attempted to use his Senate position to collect money for \u201clegal work\u201d from representatives of a Philadelphia solar company who sought Joyce\u2019s assistance with local permitting and pending legislation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce is also charged with conspiring to defraud the IRS in connection with his purchase of more than $470,000 in common stock from the energy brokerage firm and falsely reporting the stock purchase as a tax-exempt retirement account rollover in his personal tax return. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Weinreb would not say whether charges would be brought against any of the companies accused to be involved in the schemes but said the investigation remains ongoing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce, who had served as assistant majority leader, announced last year that he would not seek re-election in 2017. He had represented his district since 1998. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A 1980 graduate of Milton High School, Joyce received a bachelor\u2019s degree from Boston College School of Management and a law degree from Suffolk University Law School. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As a state legislator, Joyce served as chairman of the Special Senate Committee on Government Expenditures and the Vice Chair of the Senate Committee on Redistricting. He was also a member of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy as well as the Joint Committee on Health Care Financing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2015, then-Senate President Stan Rosenberg asked the ethics commission to review Joyce\u2019s conduct after The Boston Globe reported on potential conflicts of interest focusing on whether he used his position to boost his law practice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an unrelated case last year, Joyce agreed to pay nearly $5,000 to resolve issues raised by state campaign finance regulators, including using campaign funds for his son\u2019s 2014 high school graduation party. Joyce said there had been no finding of wrongdoing on his part in that case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The arrest is the second blow to the state Senate in the past week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosenberg announced Monday he was stepping aside as president of the chamber during a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into the circumstances surrounding reported sexual misconduct allegations by several men against his husband, Bryon Hefner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Harriette Chandler, a Worcester Democrat who is serving as acting Senate president, said in a statement about Joyce that she\u2019s confident the \u201cjustice system will come to a fair and just conclusion in the days to come.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republican Gov. Charlie Baker called the allegations against Joyce disturbing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cPeople in public life need to respect the offices they hold and that means not using them for personal gain, and if the feds believe there\u2019s enough there to justify an indictment then the investigation needs to be thorough and move forward accordingly,\u201d Baker said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last year, after federal authorities raided Joyce\u2019s law office in Canton, Baker poked fun at then-Sen. Joyce at the annual St. Patrick\u2019s Day Breakfast in Boston.

Joyce collected about $1 million in bribes and kickbacks that he laundered through his law firm, according to a sweeping 102-page indictment that accuses the Milton Democrat of turning his public office into a criminal enterprise \u2014 even accepting hundreds of pounds of free coffee from a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts owner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce, once the Senate\u2019s assistant majority leader, was taken from his Westport home in handcuffs early on Friday morning and escorted by federal agents to be booked and fingerprinted, and face federal charges of mail fraud, corruption, money laundering, and embezzlement, among many others. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Acting US Attorney William Weinreb said prosecutors launched the investigation of Joyce after a series of stories by The Boston Globe that began in January 2015 looking at Joyce\u2019s mingling of public and personal business. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Weinreb said investigators estimated that Joyce\u2019s many illegal schemes have netted him about $1 million since 2010.

He nodded to his wife and other family members. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Standing before US Magistrate Judge David Hennessy, Joyce pleaded not guilty to all the charges before he was released on $250,000 secured bond. The case was continued until a status hearing on Feb. 23. Joyce must surrender his passport, and his travel is restricted to Massachusetts and Rhode Island. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cYou just heard former senator Joyce declare in a very loud and affirmative voice in federal court that he is innocent of all these charges and he expects that\u2019s what will happen in court,\u201d said Joyce\u2019s attorney, Howard Cooper, outside the courtroom as Joyce stood by his side. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 113-count indictment describes Joyce as someone who considered his duties as an elected public official secondary to his goal of secretly amassing wealth, a goal he would achieve by using the power of his Senate office to help those who allegedly provided bribes and kickbacks to him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cDefendant Joyce\u2019s objective in conducting and participating in the affairs of the Senate Office . . . was to secretly profit from his position as State Senator [by] . . . accepting a stream of concealed bribes and kickbacks from private individuals and entities in exchange for his official action as specific opportunities arose,\u2019\u2019 the indictment reads. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce is accused of using his law office, the Joyce Law Group in Canton, \u201cas a money laundering conduit for the corrupt payments\u201d by labeling the bribes and kickbacks as legal referral fees and consulting fees for working on real estate issues, and by using the \u201ccorrupt payments\u201d to buy a 2014 Jeep, according to the indictment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR David L. Ryan/Globe Staff US Attorney William D. Weinreb addressed the media about the Joyce indictment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A developer seeking help with Milton town officials is accused of handing over the Jeep to Joyce without demanding he pay the $20,000 due on the purchase price, authorities allege. The developer, John Morrill, who owns two car dealerships, has been a longtime political supporter of Joyce. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under one scheme, federal authorities allege, Joyce spent $471,250 to purchase 65,000 shares in a company, Energi, whose business activities he was actively supporting on Beacon Hill. But Joyce never disclosed his financial ties to the company and falsely claimed the money he used to buy the stock came from a tax-free rollover of an IRA account. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cDefendant Joyce created sham retirement accounts for himself and his spouse in order to conceal his stock ownership from the Ethics Commission and to defraud the IRS,\u2019\u2019 the indictment alleges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce is also accused of collecting hundreds of pounds of coffee \u2014 along with $125,089 in \u201cpurported legal fees\u201d \u2014 from a Carlos Andrade, a major Dunkin\u2019 Donuts franchisee who sits on the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts foundation board of directors. On one occasion in 2015, he collected 504 pounds of coffee, worth an estimated $4,278, for free, authorities allege. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the Globe asked Joyce how he obtained the free coffee in 2015, he had someone else make up a fake invoice and backdate it, the indictment alleges. At the time, his lawyer insisted Joyce had paid full retail price, like anyone else. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Governor Charlie Baker told the Globe that the charges against Joyce should be a warning to anyone in public office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cPeople in public life need to respect the offices they hold, and that means not using them for personal gain,\u2019\u2019 he said Friday. \u201cAnd, if the feds believe there is enough there to justify an indictment, then the investigation needs to be thorough and move forward accordingly.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Acting Senate President Harriette Chandler issued a brief statement: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cLaw enforcement has done its job today. This case now moves to the courts, and I am confident that the justice system will come to a fair and just conclusion in the days to come.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce had been an early supporter of then Senate President Stanley Rosenberg, who appointed him assistant majority leader in 2015 and made him chairman of the committee that decided which bills would come up for a vote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, Joyce is facing more than 100 criminal charges, outpacing the corruption counts leveled against other politicians in recent years, including former House speaker Sal DiMasi and former state senator Dianne Wilkerson, who was charged with one count of bribery. DiMasi was sentenced to eight years after he was convicted of helping a software company win multimillion-dollar state contracts in exchange for kickbacks. Wilkerson was sentenced to three and a half years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If convicted on all counts, Joyce could face far more jail time. Some of the counts in the indictment carry possible sentences of up to 20 years each. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Joyce\u2019s attorney Cooper suggested that the charges against his client are the work of overzealous federal prosecutors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI should add that, in the last few years, it has been very apparent across the country that the federal government has brought a number of cases against public officials, which have either gone nowhere, or have been rejected by juries, or have been highly criticized by the courts,\u201d Cooper said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The charges against Joyce represent a stunning fall from grace over the past two years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce, 55, decided not to run for reelection in 2016 \u2014 and moved out of Milton, his longtime hometown \u2014 after the FBI and IRS raided his Canton law office. The raid followed a series of stories published by the Globe describing some of the ways in which he appeared to use his public position to get private benefits for himself and his family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce aroused suspicions by repeatedly receiving discounted and sometimes free goods and services, often from businesses in his legislative district. For instance, when he was angling for a Senate leadership position in late 2014, he gave his Senate colleagues expensive sunglasses that he got at a significant discount from a company in his district, as well as pounds of Dunkin\u2019 Donuts coffee. Joyce also received free dry cleaning from a Randolph dry cleaner for more than a decade, services worth thousands of dollars. Neither the sunglasses nor the dry cleaning were mentioned in the indictment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Through his attorney, Joyce denied any wrongdoing. He said he bartered the dry cleaning for legal work and paid for coffee and sunglasses the same price as anyone else. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Globe also wrote extensively about Joyce\u2019s relationship with Energi, the Peabody company that is the subject of much of the indictment. The company, which sells insurance to the energy industry, hired Joyce and his law firm to do legal work and to handle regulatory matters before the state Division of Insurance. Between 2010 and 2015, the company paid the Joyce Law Group $377,169 in fees, according to the indictment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even so, Joyce apparently wanted more legal business and fees in return for his help with a bill promoted by the company. He filed the bill and spoke at a symposium sponsored by Energi promoting the bill \u2014 never disclosing his ties to the company. Energi put him on retainer, paying him $5,000 a month for approximately five months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe intend to cooperate fully with the government . . . and we regret that we too were victimized by Mr. Joyce,\u201d said Brian Kelly, a lawyer who represents Energi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The indictment also describes Joyce\u2019s relationship with a company that sells solar credits, Power Management, referred to in the indictment as the \u201cenergy broker.\u201d The company paid him \u201csecret kickbacks\u201d for his help in landing the company energy consulting work with the towns of Randolph, Easton, East Bridgewater, Southbridge, and Holbrook, the indictment said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He created a shell company, \u201cWindswept LLC,\u201d where he deposited the kickbacks, the indictment says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Milton, where he lived until this year, he allegedly approached developer John Morrill about buying and redeveloping the Milton Women\u2019s Club, a historic building that had fallen into disrepair, the indictment says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce pressured the planning board to allow Morrill to take actions that would allow Morrill to build four houses on the site. In return, the indictment says, Morrill agreed to pay Joyce a kickback \u2014 a 2014 Jeep from one of his dealerships. Morrill also agreed that Joyce\u2019s wife, Mary, a local realtor, would be a sales broker for the homes built on the site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce was also accused of using his position to try to extract a $25,000 fee from a Philadelphia-based solar company, Tecta Solar. The company was looking for help with legislation and permitting for a project in West Bridgewater. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cYeah, I can get the permit for you,\u201d Joyce told Tecta officials. \u201cIt would be through my law firm, and our fee would be $25,000 . . .\u2019 according to the indictment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Company officials told the Globe in 2015 that they were stunned by his request and declined to hire him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt was suggested we could retain him, but we never pursued it. It was certainly not our intent and it was twisted in a completely different direction,\u201d said Samir Dube, who was then the company\u2019s managing director.

Miller Hits: 1763 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facing fixed-mount solar panels west instead of south could produce more electricity during peak demand according to a new study from Pecan Street Research, which debunks the conventional wisdom that solar panels should always face south when installed on homes in the northern hemisphere. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The research firm, based at the University of Texas's Austin campus, concentrates on testing and developing new technology and business models in advanced energy management systems. The company tested 50 Austin homes with solar panels, some with south-facing installations. Pecan Street used a financial incentive to convince others to install west-facing solar panels for the sake of the study, which is the first of its kind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While advanced modeling and research used by installers suggest homeowners could lose up to 30 percent of their energy production by facing solar panels west instead of south, the Pecan Street study found otherwise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Austin homes with west-facing solar panels produced 2 percent more electricity during the course of a normal day than homeowners with south-facing panels. Beyond that, they produced 49 percent more electricity during peak demand hours of 3 to 7pm. Homeowners with south-facing solar panels reduced their peak energy usage by 54 percent, while those with west-facing panels cut their power draws by 65 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThere\u2019s no other residential demand response tool generating 60 percent reductions,\u201d Brewster McCracken, CEO of Pecan Street, told Green Tech Media. \u201cThose are pretty extraordinary peak reductions.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This research has the potential to dramatically change the residential solar market. While homeowners with east-west roof pitches have historically thought they would not be good candidates for solar, it turns out their west-facing roof could be an even better spot for solar than their neighbor\u2019s south-facing roof. It essentially opens the solar market up to every homeowner who doesn\u2019t have significant shading issues. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It also means homeowners might be more inclined to install west-facing solar panels - even if they do have a south-facing roof -especially if their utility offers pricing differentiation between peak demand hours and off-peak hours. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's important to note, however, that the Austin study was conducted during the summer months. It\u2019s hard to predict what the overall outcome of the same study would be if winter months, when the sun sets shortly after electricity demand spikes, were included. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comments:\nPassage 2:\nConventional wisdom says that if you put solar panels on your roof in the Northern Hemisphere, you should point them within 30 degrees of true south to generate the most energy in the course of a year. But a new study by Pecan Street Research Institute, an Austin, Texas-based research and development organization, suggests that most people may do better at covering their own electrical use and reducing stress on utility grids during summertime peak demand periods if they aim the panels westward instead. (See related quiz: What You Don\u2019t Know About Solar Power.\u201d) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though the study has not been released publicly, Pecan Street provided a copy to National Geographic News. It analyzed 50 homes in the Austin area, looking not just at the amount of electricity generated by the panels, but at the impact on homeowners\u2019 electricity use and the utility grid during periods of summer peak electrical demand, which generally occur between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. (See related post: \u201cSolar Researchers Dig Deeper Into Snow Issue.\u201d) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study found that west-facing solar systems reduced the amount of electricity that homeowners needed to draw from the grid during summer peak demand by 65 percent. Homes with the conventional true-south orientation, in comparison, achieved a 54 percent reduction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pecan Street chief executive and study co-author Brewster McCracken explained that west-oriented panels may be more effective for many homeowners because of their lifestyles. West-oriented panels are more effective at capturing solar energy late in the afternoon, which also happens to be the time that most people get home from work and turn on their air conditioning in the summer, he said. So homeowners with panels facing in that direction are optimizing their solar power generation at precisely the time that their own usage surges, and when the utility company needs the most help coping with demand. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Additionally, McCracken said, using a west orientation for panels means that less electricity will go unused by the homeowners who generated it, and end up as surplus electricity being put back into the grid. That makes things easier for utility companies. \u201cThey\u2019re not structured to handle high levels of electricity being sent back to the grid,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they have to do that, it becomes a challenge to maintain electric reliability in an area.\u201d (See related story: \u201cNew \u2018Flexible\u2019 Power Plants Sway to Keep Up With Renewables.\u201d) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While solar panel installers have known that west-facing panels may be more effective for a while, utility companies still cling to the south-is-best rule-of-thumb, and refuse to give rebates to homeowners unless their panels are facing south, McCracken said. He\u2019s hoping that the study will prompt them to rethink their opposition to west-facing panels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Pecan Street study isn\u2019t the first to show that west-facing panels may be more effective. A California Public Utility Commission study published in 2011 also found that west-facing systems were \u201csignificantly better\u201d at offsetting peak load that south-facing ones, even though they had lower annual energy yields. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Solar Energy Industries Association spokesperson Samantha Page declined comment on the study. A spokesman for Southern California Edison said that the utility continues to recommend a conventional south orientation for solar panels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR David Mooney, laboratory program manager for solar R&D portfolio at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado, said that Pecan Street\u2019s findings weren\u2019t a surprise, but hoped that the more precise quantification would motivate both consumers and utilities to fine-tune their use of solar installations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mooney said that the benefits of tinkering with solar panel orientation would vary, depending upon the region, and that no single prescription necessarily fits all places. \u201cIn Colorado, for example, we tend to have clouds rolling in off the mountains in the west in the summer, so west-facing arrays would produce the least electricity,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would want to have a southern or eastern orientation here to get the most electricity, and that wouldn\u2019t necessarily align with the utility company\u2019s peak demand.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mooney also noted that the structure of the incentives provided by utility companies figures into how consumers chose to orient their panels. His own utility provider in Colorado, for example, offers incentives that reward optimum output over the year, rather than the amount of electricity generated during periods of peak demand. \u201cI get no benefit from shaving their peak demand, so there\u2019s no motivation to do it,\u201d he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vote and comment: \u201cWhat Energy Solution Should We Develop Next?\u201c)\nPassage 3:\nConventional wisdom in the northern hemisphere is to face solar panels south so they get the most light all day. Architects and panel installers implement this approach all the time, especially on homes. But a new study indicates that panels facing west may actually get more juice from the sun, and at more convenient times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers at the Pecan Street Research Institute did a study of homes with solar panels in Austin, Texas and found that when homeowners faced solar panels west they were able to generate 2% more electricity in a day. And they also generated more electricity in the afternoon, when power grids experience peak demand. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though a 2% increase in electricity generation isn't enormous, it would certainly add up over the life of solar panels. And the rise in afternoon performance, reducing grid dependance during peak hours by 65% as opposed to 54% for south-facing panels, could have widespread efficiency implications beyond single homes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's only one study so nothing is definitive yet, but if nothing else the research raises a good point about testing solar panel performance in practice instead of just assuming that angling south is always the way to go.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On December 7, 1999, just before being sentenced for three crimes he did not commit, Luis Vargas addressed the Los Angeles Superior Court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vargas stated, \u201c\u2026I will pray for God\u2019s mercy on all of you\u2026but as far as I\u2019m concerned, as far as I\u2019m concerned [the] individual [who] really did these crimes might really be raping someone out there, might really be killing someone out there.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The judge then handed Luis a sentence of fifty-five years to life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unfortunately for Luis and the people of Los Angeles, Luis was right. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unbeknownst to the public at the time, a methodical serial rapist known only as the \u201cTear Drop Rapist\u201d was committing eerily similar crimes. Sadly, it would take almost fifteen years, dozens of sexual assaults, and many advances in DNA science for anyone to see Luis was speaking the truth on December 7, 1999. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Luis Vargas\u2019s case originally caught the attention of the California Innocence Project (CIP) staff in 2011. His case was riddled with textbook post-conviction red flags. The most prominent red flag of all: eyewitness misidentification. In fact, the prosecution\u2019s entire case relied on the wavering identifications of three traumatized young ladies. Vargas was convicted solely on the victims\u2019 accounts of the savage attacks. Furthermore, the prosecution was beyond adamant the same person committed all three of the assaults. Perhaps one of the most disturbing legal issues in Vargas\u2019s story is that, despite the prosecution\u2019s weak, one dimensional case, the defense chose not to proffer an eyewitness identification expert. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vargas wrote a letter to CIP and included an article from the L.A. Times, chronicling the sadistic serial rape spree of the Tear Drop Rapist. The Tear Drop Rapist was described as a middle aged, small build, Hispanic male. The Tear Drop Rapist was given his moniker due to the fact that he was often described by his victims as having one or two teardrop tattoos under his eye. This was eerily the same description given by the three victims in the Vargas case. In contrast, Vargas had one faded, barely visible teardrop tattoo that he received as a homeless thirteen-year-old youth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Tear Drop Rapist committed over 30 attacks in the last decade, all within a 1.6 mile radius of the three attacks in the Vargas case. As if these facts were not enough, CIP noticed that reading the FBI\u2019s published description of the Tear Drop Rapist\u2019s modus operandi (see here) was like reading a carbon copy of the District Attorney\u2019s 1999 closing argument. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2013, CIP decided to test the only remaining physical evidence available in Vargas\u2019s case: the rape kit and clothing from one of the victims. The Los Angeles District Attorney\u2019s office agreed to test the requested items. CIP filed a California Penal Code Section 1405 motion for post- conviction DNA testing. The DNA test results revealed Vargas did not commit the rape, but the Tear Drop Rapist did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Tear Drop Rapist is attributed to having committed 35 attacks; not including the three attacks for which Vargas was convicted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On November 23, 2015, Luis Vargas was exonerated of all three sexual assaults. Through cooperation with the district attorney\u2019s office, Judge Ryan of the Los Angeles Superior Court threw out the convictions against Vargas.

Luis Vargas, 46, broke down when an LA Superior Court judge granted a petition to release him from his sentence of 55 years to life for three sex crimes. The move came after DNA evidence linked those assaults to a serial attacker known as the Teardrop Rapist, so labeled for having a teardrop tattoo under his eye, the AP notes. That man, who was never caught, is suspected of having committed about three dozen crimes in the LA area. Vargas had matched assailant descriptions, and he caught investigators' eye because he had a faded teardrop tattoo under his left eye and a 1992 rape conviction involving his girlfriend at the time, reports the Los Angeles Times. \"You can sentence me to all the years you want, but ... that individual that really did these crimes might really be raping someone out there,\" Vargas warned a judge before he was sentenced in 1999. In 2012, Vargas reached out to the California Innocence Project and asked to use DNA techniques to examine samples on the clothing of one of his alleged victims, per the Times. The DNA matched that of the victim and the Teardrop Rapist. The three victims had positively IDed Vargas as the perpetrator, but an Innocence Project attorney tells the AP it was a \"shaky witness\" case, an assertion the LA district attorney's office backed up in a recent court letter that said there were discrepancies and uncertainties in their identification of the rapist, the Times notes.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photograph courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NASA's Curiosity rover, which has been on Mars for almost a year and a half now, just delivered its largest and most important downlink so far of findings, discoveries, and conclusions. (Also see video: \"Mission to Mars.\") NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the six papers released by the journal Science report on different aspects of Mars and do it from different scientific perspectives, together they present the beginnings of a new understanding of the red planet, especially in its early epochs, three to four billion years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Early Mars, it has become increasingly apparent, was in many important ways similar to Earth. (See also \"Did Life on Earth Come From Mars?\") NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If you put together all that we're learning about Gale Crater and Mars, you really begin to chip away the rock and the sculpture inside emerges,\" said Pan Conrad, an astrobiologist with NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and a co-author on several of the papers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As described in the six Science papers, that hidden but slowly materializing landscape looks something like this: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1. Early Mars was habitable, perhaps for a long time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After concluding that rivers and streams once flowed into Gale Crater, the Curiosity team has now reported that a lake existed there as well. That surface water, as well as groundwater that likely went down hundreds of meters, possessed all that was needed to support microbial life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The period when Gale Crater was warmer, wetter, and habitable was broadly between 3.5 and 4 billion or more years ago. That period is when life on Earth is understood to have arisen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Was Mars once home to primitive extraterrestrial life? Curiosity can't and won't make that determination, but its discoveries have made the possibility of Martian life significantly more plausible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2. Water once flowed on many parts of Mars. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And that water was there at times and in forms that scientists didn't believe to be possible not long ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the major achievements of Curiosity so far has been to \"ground-truth\" observations made in recent years by the satellites orbiting the planet. Those instruments found strong hints that Mars had a watery past, and at Gale Crater they were found to be on target. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As a result, the mission has given greater credibility to the view that thousands of additional fossil formations of what appear to be ancient streams, channels, deltas, and lakes likely are just what they appeared to be. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3. \"Follow the carbon\" has been vindicated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The search for Martian carbon-based organic compounds\u2014one of the major goals of the Curiosity mission\u2014has been and will continue to be complicated and trying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While as many as six different organic compounds have been identified so far by the miniature chemistry lab called Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM), their origin remain unclear. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There's no doubt that SAM has identified organics, but we can't say with confidence yet that they are Martian in origin,\" said Douglas Ming of NASA's Johnson Space Center, and author of one of the six Curiosity papers in Science. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are at least two sources of the confounding results: The presence on Mars of a chlorine-based compound that, when heated in the SAM oven with any organic material, largely destroys the compounds. And the leak into the SAM ovens of an organic solvent brought to Mars as part of a wet chemistry experiment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The search for Martian organics is nonetheless making progress. With each collection of Martian sand or rock, the number of organics found and their concentration has increased\u2014suggesting that different samples of Martian material are leading to different results. If the organics were all contaminants from Earth, those concentrations would likely be more steady. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"SAM is probably the most complex and important instrument ever brought to another planet,\" Ming said. \"Inevitably, it has taken time to figure out how best to work with it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 4. Mars gets pounded by radiation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Galactic cosmic rays and solar eruptions bombard Mars, and their high-energy particles break the bonds that allow organisms to survive. The Radiation Assessment Detector on Curiosity has made the first measurements ever of radiation on the surface of Mars, and the results are sobering. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In another Science paper, RAD principal investigator Donald Hassler reports that the radiation would almost certainly be fatal within a few million years to any microbial life on the surface or less than several meters deep. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The RAD team used as their model the terrestrial bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans, which is capable of withstanding enormous doses of radiation, to make that assessment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Notwithstanding the high levels of radiation, Hassler reported that life could theoretically still survive on Mars today under special circumstances. If a bacteria similar to D. radiodurans appeared when early Mars was wetter, warmer, and had a more protective atmosphere, he wrote, it could have survived over the epochs through long periods of dormancy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 5. Mars radiation also damages normal chemistry. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many on the Curiosity team point to radiation damage of all carbon chemistry on Mars as a major reason why it has been so difficult to identify organics on the surface. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That effort, however, may have gotten a significant boost from one of the most unexpected developments to come out of the mission so far\u2015a method to date how long surfaces have been exposed to the sky on Mars. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Using measurements of radioactive decay also employed on Earth, Kenneth Farley of the California Institute of Technology reports that the surface of Yellowknife Bay has been exposed for some 80 million years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The discovery points to a method for finding places for the rover to drill where there has been less chemistry-damaging radiation exposure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Essentially, Farley said, the team has to look for cliffs or overhangs being undercut by the surface wind\u2015as happened in Yellowknife Bay\u2015and where radiation would be blocked by the rocks above. \"If we find that kind of formation,\" he said, \"drill there.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 6. Detours sometimes turn out to be interesting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Curiosity rover was scheduled to head for the scientifically alluring Mount Sharp in the center of Gale Crater soon after landing. More than 480 days into the mission, the rover is still months away from its prime destination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The detour to Yellowknife Bay is the main reason why, and it has turned out to be a gold mine of data. But now the rover is on what is called the \"rapid transit route\" to three-mile-high Mount Sharp, driving most of the time and passing many potentially interesting sites.\nPassage 2:\nMastcam mosaic of the Yellowknife Bay formation.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NASA's Curiosity rover has found evidence of an ancient Martian lake that could have supported life as we know it for long stretches \u2014 perhaps millions of years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This long and skinny freshwater lake likely existed about 3.7 billion years ago, researchers said, suggesting that habitable environments were present on Mars more recently than previously thought. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Quite honestly, it just looks very Earth-like,\" said Curiosity lead scientist John Grotzinger, of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. [Ancient Mars Could Have Supported Life (Photos)] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You've got an alluvial fan, which is being fed by streams that originate in mountains, that accumulates a body of water,\" Grotzinger told SPACE.com. \"That probably was not unlike what happened during the last glacial maximum in the Western U.S.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lake once covered a small portion of the 96-mile-wide (154 kilometers) Gale Crater, which the 1-ton Curiosity rover has been exploring since touching down on the Red Planet in August 2012. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yes - The Red Planet is teeming with tiny microbes, we just haven't found them yet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yes - An advanced civilization lives below the surface, where we can't detect them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No - Life never existed on Mars. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No - Mars once had life, but those organisms are long dead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The main task of Curiosity's $2.5 billion mission is to determine whether Gale Crater could ever have supported microbial life. The rover team achieved that goal months ago, announcing in March that a spot near Curiosity's landing site called Yellowknife Bay was indeed habitable billions of years ago NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new results, which are reported today (Dec. 9) in six separate papers in the journal Science, confirm and extend Curiosity's landmark discovery, painting a more complete picture of the Yellowknife Bay area long ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This picture emerged from Curiosity's analysis of fine-grained sedimentary rocks called mudstones, which generally form in calm, still water. The rover obtained powdered samples of these rocks by drilling into Yellowknife Bay outcrops. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mudstones contain clay minerals that formed in the sediments of an ancient freshwater lake, researchers said. Curiosity also spotted some of the key chemical ingredients for life in the samples, including sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lake could have potentially supported a class of microbes called chemolithoautotrophs, which obtain energy by breaking down rocks and minerals. Here on Earth, chemolithoautotrophs are commonly found in habitats beyond the reach of sunlight, such as caves and hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is exciting to think that billions of years ago, ancient microbial life may have existed in the lake's calm waters, converting a rich array of elements into energy,\" Sanjeev Gupta of Imperial College London, co-author of one of the new papers, said in a statement.

Based on the thickness of the sedimentary deposits, the research team estimates that the lake existed for at least tens of thousands of years \u2014 and perhaps much longer, albeit on a possibly on-and-off basis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Taking into account the broader geological context, \"you could wind up with an assemblage of rocks that represent streams, lakes and ancient groundwater systems \u2014 so for times when the lake might have been dry, the groundwater's still there. This could have gone on for millions or tens of millions of years,\" Grotzinger said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lack of weathering on Gale Crater's rim suggests that the area was cold when the lake existed, he added, raising the possibility that a layer of ice covered the lake on a permanent or occasional basis. But such conditions wouldn't be much of a deterrent to hardy microbes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"These are entirely viable habitable environments for chemolithoautotrophs,\" Grotzinger said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers still don't know if the Gale Crater lake hosted organisms of any kind; Curiosity was not designed to hunt for signs of life on Mars. But if chemolithoautotrophs did indeed dominate the lake, it would put an alien twist on a superficially familiar environment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You can imagine that, if life evolved on Mars and never got beyond the point of chemolithoautotrophy, then in the absence of competition from other types of microbes, these systems might have been dominated by that type of metabolic pathway,\" Grotzinger said. \"And that's an un-Earth-like situation.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow Mike Wall on Twitter @michaeldwall and Google+.

His staunch supporters praise him as a political outsider sure to shake things up at Queen's Park. (The Canadian Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They felt his reputation at Toronto city hall, where he was a key figure in the tumultuous mayoralty of his controversial late brother, Rob Ford, would undermine the modern, inclusive party they were building. At the PC policy convention last November, the one-term Toronto councillor was a solitary figure hovering alone at the back of the hall during the then leader\u2019s speech. But since taking the reins, he has brought Elliott into the fold along with another former leadership rival, Caroline Mulroney, the daughter of former prime minister Brian Mulroney. Both women will sit at Ford\u2019s cabinet table. Also expected to be ministers are the newly elected Rod Phillips and Peter Bethlenfalvy and MPPs Vic Fedeli, Lisa MacLeod, Steve Clark, and John Yakabuski. Having what was seen as a deep potential ministerial bench was critical to Ford\u2019s success. After Horwath narrowed the gap in public opinion polls following his shaky performance in the three leaders\u2019 debates last month, he scrambled to showcase his team, which he maintained was \u201cready to govern\u201d in contrast to the NDP. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many New Democratic candidates, he insisted, were \u201cradical downtown Toronto elites,\u201d who should not be given the keys to Queen\u2019s Park. However, voters may have handed Ford a blank cheque. He has promised to cut spending by $6 billion and vowed to do it painlessly without slashing even one public-sector job. \u201cNot one,\u201d he repeatedly said without specifying where he would find such massive \u201cefficiencies.\u201d His platform, never fully costed despite promises it would be, consisted of a series of populist planks like a 10 cents a litre reduction in gasoline taxes, lowering the floor price of beer to $1, selling beer and wine in convenience stores, and reducing personal and corporate taxes. On the campaign trail, his handlers limited media exposure and the freewheeling Ford from Toronto city hall was recast as a carefully scripted politician behind a teleprompter. Still, he weathered a bevy of problems, including revelations he attended a political fundraiser in April even though that\u2019s against the new campaign finance law, that he appeared to have flouted PC rules to sell memberships for candidate Kinga Surma, and that one of his former candidates was linked to the alleged data breach at the 407 ETR that compromised the personal information of 60,000 motorists. As well, Rob Ford\u2019s widow filed a $16.5 million lawsuit Friday alleging Doug Ford and older brother, Randy Ford, had cheated her and her children out of her late husband\u2019s inheritance. Doug Ford denied Renata Ford\u2019s allegations, which have not been proven in court. Yet none of these potential landmines hurt the first victorious Tory campaign since Mike Harris was re-elected in 1999. For Wynne, defeat appeared to have been preordained with Liberal insiders pointing to 2015 as the year when the wheels began to fall off. That was the year of the Sudbury byelection debacle that saw Wynne\u2019s deputy chief of staff charged with bribery and then exonerated in 2017. It was also when the premier decided to sell the majority share in Hydro One, the provincial transmission utility, using the proceeds to bankroll transportation infrastructure. Both Ford and Horwath successfully conflated the partial privatization with rising electricity bills even though that is a separate issue. Ford has even promised to fire Mayo Schmidt, the highly paid Hydro One CEO he derided as \u201cthe six million dollar man.\u201d And in 2015, Wynne injected herself into the federal election campaign, helping Justin Trudeau defeat Stephen Harper to become prime minister, but appearing in the public\u2019s eyes as just another partisan politician. \u201cOur (poll) numbers started to decline then and we never recovered,\u201d confided one senior Liberal, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal strategy. While Wynne returned to her social-justice roots, raising the minimum wage to $14 an hour from $11.60 \u2014 and promised to make it $15 next year, a raise Ford has said he will cancel \u2014 as well as introducing free prescription drug coverage for everyone under 25, it was not enough to save the Liberals.

His teeth, back and front, were also heavily worn from chewing coarse grain and use as a \"third hand\" for gripping tools and cutting. When \u00d6tzi was discovered atop a glacier on the Austro-Italian border, his frozen corpse was intensively studied. But no one took a close look at his teeth until now. Using 3D computer tomography (a CAT scan), the hunter's mouth could be examined for clues as to the life he led. The results, published this week in the European Journal of Oral Sciences, suggest that \u00d6tzi didn't have it easy. A fall or other accident killed one of his front teeth, still discolored millennia later. And he may have had a small stone, gone unnoticed in his whole-grain bread or gruel, to thank for a broken molar. That gruel may be the culprit behind \u00d6tzi's cavities and gum disease, too. (An arrow on the right in CAT scan above marks places where the bone is eaten away by infection, the left arrow points at deep cavities.) In the late Stone Age, humans were increasingly incorporating coarsely ground grain into their diets. The uptick in starches, the researchers suggest, could explain the increasing frequency of cavities in teeth from the time\u2014a problem that's been with us ever since.

Researchers have probed his stomach and bowels for traces of his last meal and analyzed his teeth for cavities. Now, an international team has sequenced his entire genome, and it turns out \u00d6tzi still has some surprises in store. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier computer scans had revealed \u00d6tzi's severe arteriosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. But the new analysis shows that \u00d6tzi had a genetic predisposition to the condition, despite the fact that as a hunter-gatherer he had none of what are currently believed to be the relevant risk factors, such as being overweight, getting too little exercise, and smoking or drinking. \"This new data suggests that we might be less able to prevent arteriosclerosis than we believed,\" notes cardiologist and mummy expert Gregory Thomas of the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the new work. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The whole genome sequencing also reveals more about \u00d6tzi's ancestors. Earlier research analyzed \u00d6tzi's mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited through only the female line, but had found few known matches among modern populations. Now sequencing of his Y chromosome places him in the rare G2A4 haplogroup, meaning that his paternal genes are linked to a population that left the Near East for Europe at the beginning of the Neolithic era, roughly 1000 years before \u00d6tzi himself lived. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u00d6tzi's genetic profile marks him as being most closely related to small populations currently living in the islands of Sardinia and Corsica, as well as some of the more remote areas of Georgia and Russia, says geneticist Angela Graefen of the Institute for Mummies and the Iceman in Bolzano, Italy, one of the principal researchers on the paper. That doesn't mean that \u00d6tzi was Sardinian or Corsican, Graefen notes, but that those populations may be the closest living genetic matches to the hunter-gatherers who originally migrated into Europe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The genome analysis, published this week in Nature Communications, also helps flesh out our picture of \u00d6tzi the man: Researchers now know he had brown eyes, brown hair, type-O blood, and shared the lactose intolerance that was then still the norm among Neolithic Europeans. He was also the first known carrier of Lyme disease: the sequencing yielded genes from the disease-causing Borrelia burgdorferi bacterium. Although scientists can't know whether Lyme disease actually made \u00d6tzi sick during his lifetime, the discovery of 60% of a B. burgdorferi genome from a Neolithic carrier shows that this pathogen has plagued humans for thousands of years. Until researchers compare the B. burgdorferi genome from \u00d6tzi with more modern incarnations of the pathogen, they won't have a clear picture of how Lyme disease evolves. \"But depending on the research other scientists are doing over the next few years, we could be gaining a lot more insights from \u00d6tzi's genome,\" Graefen says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new paper adds to our knowledge of Neolithic life, says mummy expert Frank Ruehli of the University of Zurich in Switzerland. \"Of course \u00d6tzi is only one individual, but he's a very well-preserved, well-described individual, whom we have a lot of additional information about already.

He was 84. He had homes in Manhattan and Chester, Conn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer was in declining health when he announced his retirement last week; CBS News broadcast a long-planned special hour to honor the occasion on Sunday May 15 that he watched in his home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A huge presence on 60 Minutes for 46 years -- Safer enjoyed the longest run anyone ever had on primetime network television. Though he cut back a decade ago, he still appeared regularly until recently, captivating audiences with his signature stories on art, science and culture. A dashing figure in his checked shirt, polka dot tie and pocket square, Morley Safer -- even his name had panache -- was in his true element playing pool with Jackie Gleason, delivering one of his elegant essays aboard the Orient Express or riffing on Anna Wintour, but he also asked the tough questions and did the big stories. In 2011, over 18.5 million people watched him ask Ruth Madoff how she could not have known her husband Bernard was running a billion-dollar Ponzi scheme. The interview was headline news and water cooler talk for days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is a very sad day for all of us at 60 Minutes and CBS News. Morley was a fixture, one of our pillars, and an inspiration in many ways.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In some of his later 60 Minutes pieces, Safer profiled the cartoonists of The New Yorker, interviewed the founder and staff of Wikipedia and reported on a billion-dollar art trove discovered in a Munich apartment. In his last story broadcast on March 13, he profiled the visionary architect Bjarke Ingels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Morley was one of the most important journalists in any medium, ever,\" said CBS Chairman and CEO, Leslie Moonves. \"He broke ground in war reporting and made a name that will forever be synonymous with 60 Minutes. He was also a gentleman, a scholar, a great raconteur - all of those things and much more to generations of colleagues, his legion of friends, and his family, to whom all of us at CBS offer our sincerest condolences over the loss of one of CBS' and journalism's greatest treasures.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is a very sad day for all of us at 60 Minutes and CBS News. Morley was a fixture, one of our pillars, and an inspiration in many ways. He was a master storyteller, a gentleman and a wonderful friend. We will miss him very much,\" said Jeff Fager, the executive producer of 60 Minutes and Safer's close friend and one-time 60 Minutes producer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CBS News President David Rhodes said, \"Morley Safer helped create the CBS News we know today. No correspondent had more extraordinary range, from war reporting to coverage of every aspect of modern culture. His writing alone defined original reporting. Everyone at CBS News will sorely miss Morley.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer was a familiar reporter to millions when he replaced Harry Reasoner on 60 Minutes in 1970. A much-honored foreign correspondent, Safer was the first U.S. network newsman to film a report inside Communist China. He appeared regularly on the CBS Evening News from all over the world, especially Vietnam, where his controversial reporting earned him peer praise and government condemnation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Morley Safer helped create the CBS News we know today. No correspondent had more extraordinary range, from war reporting to coverage of every aspect of modern culture.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer's piece from the Vietnamese hamlet of Cam Ne in August of 1965 showing U.S. Marines burning the villagers' thatched huts was cited by New York University as one of the 20th century's best pieces of American journalism. Some believe this report freed other journalists to stop censoring themselves and tell the raw truth about war. The controversial report on the \"CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite\" earned Safer a George Polk award and angered President Lyndon Johnson so much, he reportedly called CBS President Frank Stanton and said, \"Your boys shat on the American flag yesterday.\" Some Marines are said to have threatened Safer, but others thanked him for exposing a cruel tactic. Safer said that the pentagon treated him with contempt for the rest of his life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He spent three tours (1964-'66) as head of the CBS Saigon bureau. His helicopter was shot down in a 1965 battle, after which Safer continued to report under fire. In 1990, he penned a memoir of his Vietnam experience, \"Flashbacks: On Returning to Vietnam\" (Random House), in which he goes back to reminisce and to interview the enemy's veterans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When he joined Mike Wallace at the beginning of 60 Minutes' third season, they toiled to put stories on the air for a program that dodged cancellation each season. But their work was immediately recognized with an Emmy for Safer's 1971 investigation of the Gulf of Tonkin incident that began America's war in Vietnam. The two pressed on for five years, moving the broadcast from the bottom fourth to the middle of the rankings. Then in August 1975, with a new Sunday evening timeslot, Safer put 60 Minutes on the national stage. Interviewing Betty Ford, the first lady shocked many Americans by saying she would think it normal if her 18-year-old daughter were having sex. The historic sit-down also included frank talk about pot and abortion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By 1978, the broadcast was in Nielsen's Top 10. Safer's eloquent, sometimes quirky features balanced out the program's \"gotcha\" interviews and investigations, perfecting the news magazine's recipe. It became the number-one program for the 1979-'80 season - a crown it won five times. 60 Minutes remained in the top 10 for an unprecedented 23 straight seasons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was another Safer story that would become one of the program's most honored and important. \"Lenell Geter's in Jail,\" about a young black man serving life for armed robbery in Texas, overturned Geter's conviction 10 days after the December 1983 segment exposed a sloppy rush to injustice. Safer and 60 Minutes were honored with the industry's highest accolades: the Peabody, Emmy and duPont-Columbia University awards. 60 Minutes founder Don Hewitt often pointed to the story as the program's finest work. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Morley Safer's Pick: Lenell Geter's in Jail NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer hit more journalistic home runs, but sought out the odd stories that piqued his curiosity. The offbeat tales were more suited to his raconteur style and cultural sensibility. He found esoteric subjects all over the world and here in the U.S., ranging from a tiny Pacific island nation economically dependent on guano to the strange choice of tango dancing as a national hobby for the shy people of Finland to the strange yet harmonious stew of cowboys and artists in the Texas town of Marfa -- all narrated in his drolly delivered and precise prose. His conversational wit with his subjects was just as sharp as his written word. In a profile of the prim Martha Stewart, a smirking Safer passed her livestock pen and said to the domestic diva, \"Your barnyard? It's remarkably odor-free.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some of these features had national impact, however, like his November 1991 report, \"The French Paradox,\" which connected red wine consumption to lower incidents of heart disease among the free-eating French. Wine merchants say this report was single-handedly responsible for starting the red wine boom in America. His 1993 segment \"Yes, But is it Art?\" enraged the modern art community when it criticized expensive, contemporary installations featuring household items like toilets and vacuums. The Museum of Modern Art in New York City may have held a grudge; years later, it refused to allow Safer onto its premises to review a Jackson Pollock retrospective for CBS Sunday Morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer's life was a work of art into which 60 Minutes fit seamlessly. He vacationed in Europe, often combining field trips for his stories. He made a regular pilgrimage to The American Academy in Rome to hone his painting skills, a hobby he began from an early age. He mounted a small exhibition of his paintings in 1985. He also had a special affinity for cars and did 60 Minutes segments on England's Rolls Royce and Italy's legendary Lamborghini. He owned a silver 1985 Ferrari convertible, which he had raced occasionally and also owned a Bentley when he lived in London, bought with his winnings from a card game. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other highlights from Safer's 60 Minutes work include a poignant segment in 1978 called \"The Music of Auschwitz,\" about an inmate who played in an orchestra to avoid the Nazi gas chambers; his 1979 profile of Katharine Hepburn; \"The Beeb,\" a 1985 Emmy-winning take on BBC Radio; \"The Enemy,\" the 1989 story for which Safer returned to Vietnam; and in 1979, \"Marva,\" about Chicago teacher Marva Collins, whose alternative school for disadvantaged kids proved such students could excel. Safer's follow-up on \"Marva\" in 1996, in which he debunked a subsequent book that claimed Collins' students would not succeed in the long run, earned him his fourth duPont-Columbia University award. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to the four duPonts, Safer won every major award, including the Paul White Award from the Radio and Television News Directors Association in 1966 when he was only 35 -- an award usually given for lifetime achievement. The other awards given to Safer over his long career include three Peabody awards, three Overseas Press Club awards, two George Polk Memorial awards, a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism first prize for domestic television, the Fred Friendly First Amendment award, 12 Emmys and a Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from the French Government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CBS News hired the Canadian-born Safer in 1964 in London, where he was a correspondent for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. He got the job in an odd turn of events. One of Safer's CBC colleagues seeking a job with CBS sent a demo tape of a roundtable he anchored that included Safer. CBS news executives liked Safer better and gave him a job in the London Bureau. The young correspondent took over his new job behind the desk once occupied by another CBS legend, the late Edward R. Murrow. After a year, he was asked to open the Saigon Bureau to report on the simmering conflict in Vietnam. He was then named bureau chief in London in 1967 and reported on a variety of foreign stories beyond Britain, many of them risky assignments, including the Nigerian-Biafran War, the Middle East conflict and the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During this period he also filmed the historic CBS News Special Report \"Morley Safer's Red China Diary\" (August 1967), the first broadcast by a U.S. network news team from inside Communist China. Safer's Canadian citizenship helped get him into the country posing as a tourist interested in archeology. He and his cameraman, John Peters, were able to film the everyday lives of Chinese with a home movie camera. In a close call, suspicious authorities took Safer and Peters to meet an archeologist, who tested his knowledge. Safer knew enough about China's archeological periods to avoid arrest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer's reporting and writing also appeared on the CBS News documentary series, \"CBS Reports.\" He had a regular feature on CBS Radio, \"Morley Safer's Journal,\" that ran in 1970s. In May 1994, he hosted \"One for the Road: A Conversation with Charles Kuralt and Morley Safer,\" a CBS News special marking Kuralt's retirement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer was born Nov. 8, 1931 in Toronto and eventually became an American citizen, holding a dual citizenship. Telling MacLeans he felt \"stateless,\" he believed this status was an advantage. \"I bring a different perspective and I have no vested interests,\" he told the magazine in 1998. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Growing up, he was influenced by the writing of Ernest Hemingway and decided he would be a foreign correspondent. He attended the University of Western Ontario for only a few weeks when he dropped out to begin writing for newspapers. He first wrote for the rural Woodstock Sentinel-Review before landing a job with the much larger London (Ontario) Free-Press. He then went on to England with the help of the Commonwealth Press Union, which promised to place him in a job there. After a short stint on the Oxford Mail and Times, Reuters hired Safer in London in 1955. When he returned late that year, he found work as an editor and reporter in the Toronto headquarters of the CBC. He was chosen to produce \"CBC News Magazine\" in 1956, on which he also occasionally appeared . His first on-camera work was on assignment for the CBC covering the Suez Crisis in November 1956. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The CBC sent him back to London in 1961, from which he covered major stories in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, including the war for Algerian Independence, until he joined CBS. He was the only Western correspondent in East Berlin the night the Communists began building the Berlin Wall in August 1961. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer was asked to characterize his legacy as a journalist in a November 2000 interview with the American Archive of Television. \"I have a pretty solid body of work that emphasized the words, emphasized ideas and the craft of writing for this medium. It's not literary, I wouldn't presume to suggest that. But I think you can elevate it a little bit sometimes with the most important part of the medium, which is what people are saying -- whether they're the people being interviewed or the guy who's telling the story. It's not literature, but it can be very classy journalism.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Jane, one daughter, Sarah Bakal, her husband, Alexander Bakal, three grandchildren, a sister, and brother, both of Toronto. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Funeral arrangements are private. A memorial service will be announced at a later date.\nPassage 2:\nMorley Safer, 60 Minutes' longest-serving correspondent, died this week at age 84. Last week, the broadcast aired a tribute in honor of his retirement after 46 years on the broadcast. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To celebrate Safer's remarkable tenure, executive producer Jeff Fager called on an in-house dream team -- editor Warren Lustig and producers David Browning, Katy Textor and Michelle St. John -- to create the tribute that aired Sunday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But how do you condense five decades -- that included more than 900 stories -- into a one-hour broadcast? That was the enormous challenge they faced. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"In the simplest terms, we set out to capture Morley,\" says Browning, Safer's longtime producer, in the 60 Minutes Overtime video above. \"You want to make sure that what you're showing is representative of his work and the great variety of work that he's done.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That work included a groundbreaking 1965 CBS News report from Cam Ne, Vietnam, where Safer showed U.S. Marines torching villagers' huts, and a 60 Minutes story on Lenell Geter, a black man in Texas wrongly accused of armed robbery and later exonerated as a result of Safer's report. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There were countless stories, on every imaginable topic, each tale uniquely his own. \"They were works of art almost,\" Fager explains. \"What makes a story a Morley story is his original voice. And by that I mean not just the timbre, but [also] the quality of the storytelling, his writing.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fager recalls working as Safer's producer and bringing him the first draft of a script. Safer would look at it, stare out the window for a few seconds, and then quickly scroll a piece of paper into his trusty typewriter and rework it to his own satisfaction. Textor showed Overtime one of her scripts with a yellow piece of paper taped on where Safer had added his own better-written line. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He simply had this ability to take it to the next level,\" Browning explains. \"There's an old saying of Mark Twain's that the difference between the right word and the almost-right word is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug. And that's what Morley did. He was lightning.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While Safer claims his stories were aimed more at the ear than the eye, Fager says the correspondent's genius was his ability to link the two. \"You see lines. You hear lines. You experience while you're watching a connection with his writing to the picture,\" he says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer didn't take himself too seriously, his colleagues say, and liked to entertain his viewers. \"Morley's advice was always: if you can get them to laugh, you're home free,\" recalls Textor. \"He knew that if he could get a chuckle, you were pretty good. You were going to be okay.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also had an eye for the absurd. An amateur artist in his spare time, Safer got a kick out of ridiculing pretentiousness in the art world, even if it meant gently mocking collectors as they showed him around. \"Morley has always had a great sense of smoking out phonies and smoking out phony stories and things that just aren't right,\" Browing says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some of Safer's most memorable pieces were offbeat - or downright bizarre: A story on the popularity of tango in Finland, for instance, or a tale of crime and punishment on Furudu, a tiny island in the Maldives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Morley discovered [that] a story could be essentially what you made it to be,\" says Browning. \"If you found an interesting place to go and an interesting cast of characters, it really didn't matter if there was a huge headline there. As we say in the broadcast, the journey was really the story.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was a journey Safer enjoyed immensely. \"I've led a charmed life,\" he said in an interview. \"I mean, in every respect, I've led a charmed life as a reporter, as an individual. A lot of it is, as I said, blood, sweat, toil, and tears, but a lot of it is pure, unadulterated luck, and I've been a very lucky guy.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photos courtesy of CBS News, CBS Photo Archive and Morley Safer NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The video above was produced by Lisa Orlando, and edited by Lisa Orlando and Will Croxton.\n", "answers": ["Just days after retiring from 60 Minutes, Morley Safer is dead at age 84, reports CBS News.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Mexican actress Kate del Castillo, known for her role as a female drug kingpin in a popular telenovela, was exploring such a film project after Guzman, an admirer, reached out to her.

For years, stage folks have decried the regular mid-show disruptions wrought by the advent of the mobile phone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The issue has reached something of a tipping point recently, with Patti LuPone making headlines earlier this week for snatching away the phone of a texting audience member at the Off Broadway show in which she stars, \u201cShows for Days\u201d \u2014 and doing it without ever breaking character.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The original, and until recently the only, spotting of the species was made by American naturalist William Beebe in a 1936 visit to Clarion, one of the four Revillagigedo Islands.
